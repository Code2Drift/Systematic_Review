The WAVE/DSRC network removes the layer-2 association procedure and thus greatly differs from traditional WiFi technologies. With this capability, critical information can be sent within a very short period, making it suitable for realizing Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) safety applications and Roadside-to-Vehicle (R2V) Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) applications. In a recent project, the WAVE/DSRC technology has been studied for the use of speed enforcement system. This paper presents a case study of integrating the state-of-the-art WAVE/DSRC technology into a new-type of speed enforcement system called the Augmented Speed Enforcement (aSE) system. The design, the architecture, and the details of field tests in Los Banos, California, will be discussed.

An MPE program deploys operators driving vehicles equipped with radar and photo equipment to roadway locations where speeding and collision problems are significant. We developed a binary integer linear programming model to allocate MPE shifts over the course of a month to selected enforcement locations. These locations are pre-determined from a set of city neighborhoods chosen for enforcement through a prior multi-objective programming step. A major feature of the scheduling model is to observe the time halo effects of enforcement; our optimization model minimizes visits to an enforcement location over consecutive shifts. The model was applied to data obtained from the currently operating MPE program in Edmonton, Canada. Based on the resource allocation in neighborhoods determined in the previous stage, this scheduling model produces a scheduling plan that allocates resources to individual enforcement sites within each city neighborhood during a month. The purpose of this scheduling model, in combination with the first stage neighborhood allocation model, is to provide enforcement agencies with a tool to systematically and transparently assign limited resources in an efficient manner, providing greater efficacy in achieving program-level objectives such as reducing speeding, reducing collisions, and providing enforcement presence in areas with many vulnerable pedestrians (i.e. school zones).","","978-1-5386-0437-3","10.1109/ICTIS.2017.8047835","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8047835","resource scheduling;mobile photo enforcement;integer linear programming;time halo effect","Resource management;Schedules;Urban areas;Optimization;Mobile communication;Time-frequency analysis","","1","","13","IEEE","21 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents two approaches to augment these devices by calculating the absolute speed. The manual mode approach uses an additional intermediate measurement and geometric calculation, whereas the automatic mode makes use of MEMS sensor(s) to calculate the tangential velocity component as an intermediate step. The goal is to provide traffic speed enforcers tools that ultimately lead to safer roadways.

This research introduces a unique method for detecting and enforcing speeding violations using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the Internet of Things (IoT). The system employs deep learning and collects data in real-time from IoT devices. In this case, it describes developing a CNN–based method for analyzing traffic camera footage in real-time. The CNN model reliably detects moving objects and estimates their velocity. Accurate vehicle tracking is achieved by integrating data from IoT sensors, such as global positioning and vehicle identification systems. Cloud computing allows for the transfer and processing of data in near real-time. It shows that this combined method may successfully identify speeding violations. The IoT data verified the results, indicating that the CNN model had an accuracy of over 90% in speed estimation, which allowed for automated enforcement measures. Enforcement response times can also be drastically reduced by including real-time monitoring and alerting. The system provides a viable approach for speed violation identification and enforcement by merging CNN image processing with IoT data, leading to safer road environments and fewer accidents. It predicts this technique will significantly improve road safety on a global scale, which will, in turn, revolutionize traffic management.","","979-8-3503-1912-5","10.1109/SMARTGENCON60755.2023.10441950","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10441950","Speed Violation;Real-time Monitoring;Automated Enforcement;Road Safety;Speed Estimation","Law enforcement;Image processing;Real-time systems;Road safety;Internet of Things;Convolutional neural networks;Accidents","","","","15","IEEE","28 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the next two-month period the public were informed of the scheme by various publicity means and were told to obey the speed limits. Since the tests were carried out within a closed area, in both stages more or less the same profile of drivers were studied, hence the findings are expected to reflect directly the effects of the application. It was found that in most corridors the average speeds were lower in the second stage.

After removal of instances of interference, 1538 driving behaviors were recorded. Binary logistic regression was used to examine the risk of speeding as a function of covariates and interaction terms. The results of analysis revealed that the major contributing factors for approaching speed were traffic-light condition, vehicle type and drivers' gender. Analysis of binary logistic regression showed that male van drivers had the greatest speeding propensity in our sample (OR = 24.36).

In this paper, a field study is described of two different principles to assess the effectiveness of such devices to calm the traffic, installed in two highway locations. While one methodology was based upon a speed gun, mounted in a following car, the second one was based upon the analysis of videos of a traffic before and after the speed controller devices.

Over time, for installed camera systems in the field, several problems can develop, such as external flash unit failures, focus drifts, and exposure issues. Thus, it is important to periodically monitor the nighttime images/videos taken by the camera system to ensure nominal functionality. However, due to constantly changing scene elements, it is not practical to compare a historical reference image with an identical scene against current camera output to detect problems. To address this, we present image quality metrics that can be extracted without a nominal reference image and can be used to characterize these problems. These can be incorporated into algorithms that can enable automated camera diagnostics for intelligent transportation systems.","2153-0017","978-1-4673-3063-3","10.1109/ITSC.2012.6338742","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6338742","","Measurement;Vehicles;Cameras;Lighting;Licenses;Image segmentation;Image color analysis","","6","1","14","IEEE","25 Oct 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In addition, other persistent view changes resulting from new scene elements of interest being captured, such as stalled cars, suspicious packages, etc. might warrant alarms. Since these systems are often unattended, it is often important to automatically detect such incidents early. In this paper, we describe innovative algorithms to address these problems. A novel approach that uses the image edge map to detect near-field obstructions without a reference image of the unobstructed scene is presented. A second algorithm that can be used to detect more generic obstructions and persistent view changes using a learned scene element cluster map is then discussed.

To reduce speeding, it is essential to devise efficient schemes for ubiquitous speed monitoring. Traditional approaches either suffers from using special equipment(e.g., radar speed gun) or special deployment(e.g., position-fixed cameras). In this article, we propose SpeedTalker, a mobile phone-based approach to perform speed detection on automobiles. By leveraging the built-in microphones and camera from the mobile phone, SpeedTalker estimates the automobile speed by passively sensing the acoustic and image signals. We propose an integrated solution to effectively estimate the automobile’s speed based on COTS devices, and provide a platform for every pedestrian to help report the speeding event of automobiles. Specifically, we use the time difference of arrivals (TDOA) model based on acoustic signals to figure out the candidate trajectories of automobile, and use the pin-hole model based on image frames to figure out the vertical distance between the user’s position and the automobile’s trajectory, thus to estimate the unique trajectory. Combined with the time stamp of the trajectory, the automobile speed can be estimated. Besides, we propose a method to effectively mitigate the influence of the movement jitters of mobile phone. We implemented a system prototype for SpeedTalker and estimated the automobile speed with high accuracy. Experiment results show that in the scenario of single automobile, SpeedTalker can achieve an average estimation error of 6.1 percent compared to radar speed guns. In the scenario of multiple automobiles, SpeedTalker can achieve an average estimation error of 9.8 percent, which is acceptable for usage.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2020.3034354","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61872174,61832008,61802169,61872173,61902175); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20180325,BK20190293); Collaborative Innovation Center of Novel Software Technology and Industrialization; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9242267","Automobile speed estimation;microphone;camera;TDOA","Automobiles;Cameras;Mobile handsets;Acoustics;Microphones;Trajectory;Sensors","","4","","34","IEEE","28 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this work, we demonstrate a novel method to estimate speed of vehicle in the traffic video without using the additional sensor. We implement two speed measurement models which are measuring traveling distance of the vehicle in a given unit of time and measuring traveling time in a given unit of distance. To get parameters of the models, we define four virtual intrusion lines on road in the camera view. Then, YOLOv3, DeepSORT, GoodFeatureToTrack, and Pyramidal Lucas-Kanade optical flow algorithm are implemented together to detect and track the target vehicle while moving in the camera view. From the tracking data, pixel displacement between two consecutive frames (before and after the vehicle crossing the line) is measured as Crossing distance. The number of frames that the vehicle uses while moving from the first line to the other lines is measured as Traveling time. These two parameters at each intrusion line are used as speed measurement metrics. Solution of the metrics are solved by using tracking data of 20 vehicles at 9 different ground truth speeds measured by a laser speed gun. Then, the metrics are used to estimate speed of 813 vehicles. Our best accuracy is with MAE of 3.38 and RMSE of 4.69 km/h when comparing to their ground truth speed. The same dataset are tested on a Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network model. It can reach accuracy with MAE of 3.07 km/h (RMSE 3.98 km/h).","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3350381","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10381710","Vehicle speed estimation;DeepSORT;YOLOv3;GoodFeatureToTrack;Lucas-Kanade;optical flow;vehicle tracking","Cameras;Velocity measurement;Roads;Measurement;Estimation;YOLO;Machine learning algorithms;Vehicle dynamics;Vehicle driving;Tracking","","","","44","CCBYNCND","5 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Traditionally, this task has been partially solved using radar and/or laser technologies and, more recently, using video-camera based systems. All these systems have significant shortcomings that have yet to be overcome. The main drawback of classical Doppler radar technology is that the velocity measurement fails when several vehicles are in the radars beam. Modern radar systems are able to measure speed and range between vehicle and radar. However, this is not enough to discriminate the lane where the vehicle is driving on. The limitation of several vehicles in the beam is overcome using laser technology. However, laser systems have another important limitation: They cannot measure the speed of several vehicles simultaneously. Novel video-camera systems, based on license plate identification, solve the previous drawbacks, but they have the problem that they can only measure average speed but never top-speed. This paper studies the feasibility of using an interferometric linear frequency modulated continuous wave radar to improve top-speed enforcement on roadways. Two different systems based on down-the-road and across-the-road radar configurations are presented. The main advantage of the proposed solutions is they can simultaneously measure speed, range, and lane of several vehicles, allowing the univocal identification of the offenders. A detailed analysis about the operation and accuracy of these solutions is reported. In addition, the feasibility of the proposed techniques has been demonstrated with simulations and real experiments using a Ka-band interferometric radar developed by our research group.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2012.2186323","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6144059","Automotive radar;road traffic control;road vehicle location monitoring;road vehicle radar;traffic control (transportation)","Vehicles;Measurement by laser beam;Roads;Doppler radar;Uncertainty;Laser radar","","55","","17","IEEE","31 Jan 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We have conducted an analysis of whether target-aspect-dependent radar cross section (RCS) could have an effect on the accuracy of speed measurements. It was found that there is the potential for a 2.5% error (for a radar aligned at 22"" to the road, with a -3 dB beamwidth of 5"") in the speed measured by the radar devices. This is because of the interference between the RCS and the radar beam pattern, if only the main lobe is considered. There are cases, however, when the interference between the RCS and the radar beam patterns are such that the strongest return occurs in the first sidelobe. In these cases, the potential speed error is about 7%. This would be unlikely to occur in practice, however, because of the inverse fourth-power relationship with range.

Although it is observed from the results that minibus taxi drivers do not currently take advantage of fuel-saving driving patterns, it is also proven that, based on their current driving patterns, these drivers could potentially increase their remuneration per weekend by as much as 173% should they comply with posted speed limits.","","978-1-5386-7024-8","10.1109/ITSC.2019.8917491","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8917491","","Public transportation;Fuels;Vehicles;Global Positioning System;Mathematical model;Extrapolation;Industries","","","","22","IEEE","28 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditional methods of limiting speed have only been moderately effective. Using the latest intelligent transportation technology, speed enforcement can be enhanced through vehicle speed management programs, often referred to as intelligent speed adaptation (ISA). An ISA system monitors the location and speed of the vehicle, compares it to a defined set speed, and takes corrective action such as advising the driver and/or governing the top speed of the vehicle. ISA is an active research field in Europe where it is currently being evaluated. In addition to safety improvements, ISA has the potential to mitigate congestion by smoothing traffic flow during congested conditions, which may also lead to lower fuel consumption and pollutant emissions. In this paper, the energy and emissions impacts of ISA are investigated in detail using both simulation tools and real-world experimentation. This research makes use of state-of-the-art transportation/emissions modeling tools. The simulation analysis is focused on examining different speed management strategies under varying freeway congestion conditions. A set of limited real-world experiments have also been performed using real-time traffic information provided to an ISA-equipped vehicle driving in traffic. Results are compared to another non-equipped-ISA vehicle acting as a control, representing the general traffic flow. Preliminary results indicate that significant reductions are possible for both fuel consumption and emissions without drastically affecting travel time","2153-0017","1-4244-0093-7","10.1109/ITSC.2006.1707395","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1707395","","Instruction sets;Traffic control;Fuels;Vehicle driving;Pollution;Intelligent vehicles;Road vehicles;Road accidents;Intelligent transportation systems;Technology management","","38","1","19","IEEE","9 Oct 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The portion of license plates that can be correctly recognized and matched at two separate stations is typically in the range of 35% or less. Existing methods for improving the matching of plates recognized by LPR units rely on intensive manual data reduction, such that the misread plates are manually entered into the system. Recently, an advanced matching technique that combines Bayesian probability and Levenshtein text-mining techniques was proposed to increase the accuracy of automated license plate matching. The key component of this method is what we called the association matrix, which contains the conditional probabilities of observing one character at one station for a given observed character at another station. However, the estimation of the association matrix relies on the manually extracted ground truth of a large number of plates, which is a cumbersome and tedious process. To overcome this drawback, in this study, we propose an ingenious novel self-learning algorithm that eliminates the need for extracting ground truth manually. These automatically learned association matrices are found to perform well in the correctness in plate matching, in comparison with those generated from the painstaking manual method. Furthermore, these automatically learned association matrices outperform their manual counterparts in reducing false matching rates. The automatic self-learning method is also cheaper and easier to implement and continues to improve and correct itself over time.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2013.2270107","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6573397","Edit distance (ED);license plate recognition (LPR);text mining;vehicle tracking","Character recognition;Object tracking;Text mining;Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis","","17","","14","USGov","2 Aug 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The commands and advisories provided to the locomotive represent signal aspects, stops, speed limits, and track conditions. Once received, the locomotive performs appropriate actions to ensure safe navigation. CBTC networks that utilize SDR technologies may be subject to cyber security attacks which would compromise safe navigation of trains and possibly lead to collisions with other trains or endanger railroad workers. As a solution, Rail Radio Intrusion Detection System (RRIDS) is introduced to detect and deter cyber attacks such as: command replay, guessing, and message corruption attacks. RRIDS is a rail command specific IDS designed for locomotive and beacon communications security. RRIDS performs intrusion detection in near real time.

However, the open communication channels among various entities, including smart vehicles, roadside infrastructure, and fleet management systems, introduce security and privacy vulnerabilities. To address these concerns, we propose a novel security framework, named blockchain-assisted lightweight authenticated key agreement security framework for smart vehicles-enabled ITS (BASF-ITS), which ensures data protection both during transit and while stored on cloud servers. BASF-ITS employs a combination of efficient cryptographic primitives, including hash functions, XOR operator, ASCON, elliptic curve cryptography, and physical unclonable functions (PUF), to design authenticated key agreement schemes. The inclusion of PUF significantly enhances the system’s resistance to physical attacks, preventing tampering attempts. To ensure data integrity when stored on the cloud, our framework incorporates blockchain technology. By leveraging the immutability and decentralization of the blockchain, BASF-ITS effectively safeguards data at rest, providing an additional layer of security. We rigorously analyze the security of BASF-ITS and demonstrate its strong resistance against potential security ass aults, making it a robust and reliable solution for smart vehicle-enabled ITS. In a comparative analysis with contemporary competing schemes, BASF-ITS emerges as a promising approach, offering superior functionality traits, enhanced security features, and reduced computation, communication, and storage costs. Furthermore, we present a practical implementation of BASF-ITS using blockchain technology, showcasing the computational time versus the “transactions per block” and the “number of mined blocks”, confirming its efficiency and viability in real-world scenarios. Note to Practitioners—This article is motivated by designing an efficient, lightweight, and anonymous blockchain-enabled authenticated security framework that can fix the security and privacy concerns in insecure environments for ITS applications, such as automated road speed enforcement, collision avoidance alarm systems, and traffic planning and management, etc. Authenticated key agreement schemes are extensively used to secure communications in the ITS environment. However, the existing state-of-the-art schemes are not efficient in terms of performance, are not resilient against potential security attacks, and do not support anonymity, untraceability, and unlinkability. Therefore, we propose the authenticated security framework to secure communication among the participating entities in the ITS environment. It utilizes efficient cryptographic primitives, such as hash function, XOR-operator, ASCON, elliptic curve cryptography, and PUF. It is shown that the proposed framework can be deployed as a robust tool to address the ITS security problems efficiently. Moreover, the proposed framework is lightweight and efficient and can be easily deployed in various ITS applications and other resource-constrained environments. However, the participating entities, such as vehicles and roadside units, must be PUF-enabled to deploy the proposed framework.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2024.3381068","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10487806","Internet of vehicles;intelligent transportation system;authentication;key agreement;blockchain;security","Security;Blockchains;Authentication;Hash functions;Servers;Elliptic curve cryptography;Vehicular ad hoc networks","","","","","IEEE","2 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

They go as far as driving over the differentiated speed limit of the lighter passenger vehicles used for private transport. This paper compares and evaluates improvements in their speed compliance using two renowned interventions: automated Average Speed Enforcement (ASE), and auditory Intelligent Speed Adaptation (ISA). It also investigates the impact of each intervention on fuel consumption to provide an additional incentive to the most efficient intervention. The main finding was that for minibus taxis, ASE needs ISA as a supplementary intervention. It was discovered that the drivers showed little or no behavioural change while driving on the ASE route, while the introduction of the ISA system resulted in significant changes bringing violation frequencies down to 47.4% from 81.2% on the enforcement route. These behavioural changes also resulted in lower fuel consumption rates especially while the ISA system was active. However fuel economy did not seem to work as a self-regulatory incentive for speed compliance.","","978-1-4799-7560-0","10.1109/SSCI.2015.15","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7376588","","Vehicles;Public transportation;Cameras;Fuels;Global Positioning System;Roads;Cities and towns","","","","40","IEEE","11 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We have conducted an analysis of whether target-aspect-dependent radar cross section (RCS) could have an effect on the accuracy of speed measurements. It was found that there is the potential for a 2.5% error (for a radar aligned at 22/spl deg/ to the road, with a -3 dB beamwidth of 5/spl deg/) in the speed measured by the radar devices. This is because of the interference between the RCS and the radar beam pattern, if only the main lobe is considered. There are cases, however, when the interference between the RCS and the radar beam patterns are such that the strongest return occurs in the first sidelobe. In these cases, the potential speed error is about 7%. This would be unlikely to occur in practice, however, because of the inverse fourth-power relationship with range. We have not included the details of RCS sidelobe returns in the analysis.","1558-4143","","10.1109/MAP.2004.1374005","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1374005","","Radar cross section;Velocity measurement;Radar measurements;Interference;Roads","","","","","IEEE","3 Jan 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"
