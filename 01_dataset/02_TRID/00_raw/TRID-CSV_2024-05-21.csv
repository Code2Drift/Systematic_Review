2367118,01914662,Enhanced Safety of Heavy-Duty Vehicles on Highways through Automatic Speed Enforcement – A Simulation Study,,DO,English,,,https://doi.org/10.4271/2024-01-1964,,,SAE International,,"Highway safety remains a significant concern, especially in mixed traffic scenarios involving heavy-duty vehicles (HDV) and smaller passenger cars. The vulnerability of HDVs following closely behind smaller cars is evident in incidents involving the lead vehicle, potentially leading to catastrophic rear-end collisions. This paper explores how automatic speed enforcement systems, using speed cameras, can mitigate risks for HDVs in such critical situations. While historical crash data consistently demonstrates the reduction of accidents near speed cameras, this paper goes beyond the conventional notion of crash occurrence reduction. Instead, it investigates the profound impact of driver behavior changes within desired travel speed distribution, especially around speed cameras, and their contribution to the safety of trailing vehicles, with a specific focus on heavy-duty trucks in accident-prone scenarios. To conduct this analysis, we utilize SUMO, an open-source microscopic traffic simulator, enabling realistic simulations of real-world driving behaviors with and without speed cameras. The simulations also consider empirical distributions of desired headway gaps and reaction times exhibited by human drivers. This study offers a fresh perspective on highway safety by examining how the influence of automatic speed enforcement systems on driver behavior enhances the safety of HDV when faced with challenging situations. By shedding light on these dynamics, we contribute valuable insights to the ongoing research efforts on using technology to create safer roadways, ultimately promoting safer coexistence between heavy-duty and passenger vehicles.",Abstract reprinted with permission of SAE International.,"TRIS, SAE",2024-01-1964,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Behavior, Drivers, Heavy duty trucks, Logistics, Reaction time, Rear end crashes","Highways, Vehicles and Equipment",4/15/2024 3:05:00 PM,4/16/2024 9:52:00 AM,Web,,,"Shiledar, Ankur","Sujan, Vivek","Siekmann, Adam","Yuan, Jinghui",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,References,2024-04-09,SAE Technical Paper,WCX SAE World Congress Experience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Find a library where document is available,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

In the U.S., restricted speed operation is a common type of train operation on virtually every mile of automatic blocks and is also common in terminals and yards. From February 2017 to May 2020, the Federal Railroad Administration supported Rutgers University and HNTB Corporation in analyzing the frequency, severity, and other characteristics of restricted-speed train accidents. The team evaluated the safety benefits, incremental costs, and operational impacts of implementing Positive Train Control (PTC) in restricted-speed train operations, focusing on end-of-track collision prevention. A Concept of Operations (ConOps) was proposed, with a “what-if” scenario-based analysis for the Advanced Civil Speed Enforcement System (ACSES) and Interoperable Electronic Train Management System (I-ETMS). A benefit-cost analysis indicated that the safety benefits may exceed the incremental costs if PTC is enforced to prevent end-of-track collisions over a 20-year period under specified circumstances and assumptions.

We use a quasi-experimental research design that compares intervention and control segments before and after installing 90 fixed speed cameras in selected arterial road segments of Bogotá, followed by a confirmatory spatial statistical analysis. Our statistical tests strongly suggest that fixed speed cameras induce compensatory behaviors, noticeably reducing the overall effect of these investments.

2315950,01904553,Assessing driver behavior in work zones: A discretized duration approach to predict speeding,,DO,English,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aap.2023.107427,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001457523004748,,,,"Higher speeds in work zones have been linked to an increased likelihood of crashes and more severe crash outcomes. To enhance safety, speed limits are often reduced in work zones, aiming to create a steady flow of traffic and safer traffic operations such as merging and flagging. However, this speed reduction can also lead to abrupt speed changes, resulting from sudden braking or acceleration, increasing the risk of crashes. This disruption in speed and flow results increases the likelihood of rear-end crashes. Ensuring driver compliance with the reduced speed limits and traffic flow operations is challenging as work zones may cause frustration and lead to more instances of speeding. Therefore, proactively predicting speeding events in work zones can be crucial for the safety of both workers and road users, as it enables the implementation of speed enforcement measures to maintain and improve driver compliance in advance. In this study, the authors employ the duration-based prediction framework to forecast speeding occurrences in work zones. The model is used to identify significant predictors of speeding including visibility, number of lanes, posted speed limit, segment length, coefficient of variation in speed, and travel time index. Among these variables, the number of lanes, posted speed limit, and coefficient of variation of speed are positively associated with speeding. On the other hand, visibility, segment length, and travel time index are negatively associated with speeding. Results show the model’s predictive accuracy is higher for speeding events with shorter durations between consecutive occurrences. The model predicted speeding within 61% of the actual epoch when speeding events within 5 h of one another were considered for validation. This indicates that the model is more effective for road segments and work zones where speeding occurs more frequently. The prediction framework can be a great asset for agencies to improve work zone safety in real-time by enabling them to proactively implement effective work zone enforcement measures to control speeding and to stay prepared, preventing potential hazards.",© 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

The initial evaluation included an SFT positioned at the start or end of the taper within a freeway single-lane closure to determine which position provided the most favorable speed reductions. Positioning the SFT near the end of the taper caused the speed reductions to be sustained over a greater distance into the work zone compared with when the SFT was positioned near the start of the taper. With the SFT positioned near end of the taper, the average speed was 1.5 mph lower at the end of the taper and 0.8 mph lower 1,350-ft beyond the end of the taper compared with when the SFT was inactive. The second evaluation assessed the effectiveness of a specialized work zone enforcement strategy that included a covert speed measurement vehicle positioned near the end of the work zone along with four police cars positioned just beyond the end of the work zone to stop speeding drivers. This speed enforcement strategy reduced work zone speeds by up to 7 mph, on average, shortly beyond the end of the work zone as motorists passed by the police cars positioned on the shoulder.

Camera installation also coincided with rapidly changing traffic safety outcomes throughout the summer after COVID-19 lockdowns and protests against police violence. To find the most appropriate control segments for their analysis, the authors use k-means clustering to identify the five most similar roadways. Compared with these roadways and other geographic controls, the treated sections of Roosevelt Boulevard experienced decreased crashes, injuries, and fatalities after camera installation. These decreases are on the high end of what is found in the academic literature on speed cameras. The findings for total crashes, traffic injuries, fatalities, and pedestrian injuries are statistically different from zero with a high degree of confidence. Differences in pedestrian fatalities are statistically different from zero with 90% confidence. Based on their findings, the authors recommend that the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and City of Philadelphia extend and expand the automated speed enforcement pilot.

This is typically due to both the increased frequency of dangerous crash types and the increased severity of said crash types. Rollover crashes while quite rare are a particularly dangerous crash type among other various crash types. In the case of Namibia, rollover crashes reportedly accounted for 34% of both road related injuries and fatalities in Namibia for 2020. When compared to high-income countries the issue of rollover crash severity in Namibia and like sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries becomes apparent. Therefore, it crucial to understand the contributing factors and their associated effects on rollover crash severities in these countries. This study aims to investigate and identify the significant factors influencing crash severities and their associated impact magnitudes on single-vehicle rollover crashes in Namibia by adopting a mixed logit with heterogeneity in means and variances approach to account for unobserved heterogeneity in the data. Although it is not without its limitations the dataset used in this study includes single-vehicles rollover crash instances from 2014 to 2016 within Namibia and is able to provide unique details for the crash observations including various driver, environmental, roadway, and vehicle characteristics. Results from this study indicate several factors including weekends, open roadways, and minibuses to be significantly increasing the crash severity of single-vehicle rollover crashes. Additionally, results provide a basis for which researchers and policy makers can understand rollover crashes in Namibia and adopt an appropriate approach to address this issue, such as, Safe Systems.

Two years earlier, the Pennsylvania legislature had approved the camera installation in light of high fatality rates and requests from City officials. In the previous 5 years, the Boulevard had accounted for 14% of the City of Philadelphia’s total traffic fatalities. The twelve-lane at grade highway frequently makes lists of the most dangerous intersections and roadways in the country, a particularly egregious statistics since Philadelphia has only about half the national traffic fatality rate. Just three months earlier, Covid-19-related shutdowns dramatically influenced the geography of travel and traffic safety. Collision rates and traffic fatalities skyrocketed throughout the city, likely a result of a combination of decreased congestion, increased drunk driving, and decreased traffic enforcement in the wake of protests against the murder of George Floyd and for police reform. This project examines the effectiveness of the Roosevelt Boulevard using a differences-in-differences approach with a Bayesian Poisson and Negative Binomial models. Selection of control segments will be of utmost importance given the dramatic changes in crashes and fatalities over the period of study. Findings will help inform whether to continue the Boulevard speed camera program, increase the use of speed cameras throughout the state, and potentially liberalize state laws that prevent municipalities from deploying automated speed enforcement without state legislation.

This paper also establishes a link between traffic density and the odds of speeding. For this purpose, hourly speed and volume probe data were collected on limited access highway segments for the U.S. states of Maine and Connecticut to estimate the traffic density. The traffic density was then combined with the roadway geometric characteristics, speed limit, as well as dummy variables denoting the time of the week, time of the day, COVID-19 phases (before, during and after stay-at-home order), and the interactions between them. Density, represented in the model as Level of Service, was found to be associated with the odds of speeding, with better levels of service such as A, or B (low density) resulting in the higher odds that drivers would speed. The authors also found that narrower shoulder width could result in lower odds of speeding. Furthermore, the authors found that during the stay-at-home order, the odds of speeding by more than 10, 15, and 20 mph increased respectively by 54%, 71% and 85% in Connecticut, and by 15%, 36%, and 65% in Maine during evening peak hours. Additionally, one year after the onset of the pandemic, during evening peak hours, the odds of speeding greater than 10, 15, and 20 mph were still 35%, 29%, and 19% greater in Connecticut and 35% 35% and 20% greater in Maine compared to before pandemic.",© 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

The researchers coordinated with the Stafford County, Virginia, Sheriff’s Office to implement countermeasures on corridors with safety concerns where speed was a factor. Speed and enforcement data were collected to look at the impacts of the enforcement efforts. Data were collected using radar-based speed sensors placed on targeted roadways with speeding problems and shared with the Sheriff’s Office. From this data the law enforcement officers were able to make decisions on where countermeasures would be applied and what countermeasures would be implemented. The countermeasures or speed reduction activities included deputy presence with on-site enforcement, decoy cars, speed trailers with digital feedback signs, and changeable message signs. The Sheriff’s Office also used social media to release public service announcements about the safety campaigns. Decoy cars proved to be the most successful activity that led to drivers reducing their speeds for more than a day. This was likely influenced by length of deployment time at a given location. Speed trailers and deputies on-site issuing citations were also effective. However, the effects seemed to be localized. In other words, speeds were reduced in the location of the speed enforcement activity but did not carry over to adjacent locations on the segment. Finally, this study found the number of speeders to be a statistically significant predictor of crashes, and showed that traffic volumes can increase without a concurrent increase in crashes if the increased volume is made up of non-speeders.",,"HSL, NTL, TRIS, ATRI, USDOT",DOT HS 813 467,,,,,,,,,,DTNH22-11-D-00229 / 0002,,,,,,,,,,"Countermeasures, Highway safety, Law enforcement, Speeding, Stafford County (Virginia)","Highways, Operations and Traffic Management, Safety and Human Factors",7/11/2023 5:01:00 PM,7/18/2023 9:16:00 AM,Digital/other,41p,,"Katz, Bryan","Jackson, Steve","Kissner, Erin","Rigdon, Heather",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Appendices, Figures, Maps, Photos, References, Tables",2023-07-00,,,,,,,,,,,,,"toXcel, LLC",National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Final Report,September 2014– February 2019,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

These cameras are usually placed in areas with significant crashes related to speeding. However, in many countries, detailed crash data are not available or are of poor quality. This study aims to propose and explore three simple ranking methods for identifying optimal locations for speed enforcement cameras that do not depend on crash records. The first method is based on the Star Rating Scores and the traffic volume data. The second method relies on developing a data-driven model for predicting speeding violation rate (VR) based on road geometry aspects and comparing it with available road segment crash risk. The third method uses a combination of the first two methods. The proposed methods and prediction models were applied to a case study and successfully identified the optimal location for speed enforcement cameras. The developed prediction models suggest that speed limit, junction spacing, and the number of access points per kilometer are the most common variables to estimate speed VRs for both urban and rural roads. Availability of service roads and the number of lanes were variables that affect the speed VR on urban roads only. The proposed methods are considered valuable simple tools for road safety practitioners to effectively prepare speed enforcement plans for different road networks.",Khaled Shaaban https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9667-252X© National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2022.,"TRIS, TRB, ATRI",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Cameras, Case studies, Location, Optimization, Speed limits, Traffic law enforcement","Highways, Operations and Traffic Management",10/22/2022 3:01:00 PM,4/8/2023 3:00:00 PM,Web,pp 1512-1524,,"Shaaban, Khaled","Mohammad, Anas","Eleimat, Ahid",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,References,2023-03-00,Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Find a library where document is available,,,,,,,,,,,2677,3,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

The purpose of this TRS is to review relevant research regarding the impact of SSCs as a standalone countermeasure to: reduce and manage speeds, to reduce the severity and frequency of crashes, and to understand spillover or other unintended consequences. Just over 150 communities and 20 states within the US are currently using SSC systems.

Of the eight SSC studies and six literature reviews that conducted multi-year crash history analysis before and after the implementation of SSC programs, all found reductions in the number of fatal and severe crashes. Of the studies that reported both overall crashes as well as serious and fatal crashes, all concluded that SSCs resulted in the greatest reductions for serious injury and fatal crashes. No increase in crash rates or other adverse safety effects were reported. Results are consistent with other literature reviews published from 2005 to 2010.

ASE and red-light cameras help reduce most crashes, such as fatal crashes, injury crashes, and property damage crashes worldwide. Millions of people die yearly because of car crashes, and many more are severely injured. Due to the high number of fatal and injury crashes, to reduce deaths, many countries across different continents in the world started enforcing ASE and red-light cameras to mitigate the number of crashes. ASE and red-light cameras are enormously effective measures to reduce the totality of crashes. Unfortunately, despite the proven efficacy, many states in the United States and worldwide prohibit using ASE. Some prohibit red-light and speed cameras, such as New Hampshire, South Carolina, Maine, West Virginia, and Texas. Certain states only prohibit red-light cameras, including Montana and South Dakota, and some states do not allow speed cameras, counting Wisconsin and New Jersey. This paper will examine the reasons behind prohibiting automated speed enforcement technology. Additionally, the study will collect and analyze data from the United States, Canada, and Saudi Arabia regarding the amount each country levies for penalties and fines for ASE violations. Some of the public believe that automated speed enforcement techniques are a method for the government to generate revenue.

2205372,01887902,The Prevalence and Profile of Speeding in Vehicle Crashes Using Event Data Recorders,,DO,English,,,https://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/departments/esv/27th/,,,,,"Travelling at a speed above the speed limit is commonly known as speeding. Prior studies examining the prevalence and profile of speeding in Australia (and other countries) have used data from various sources, including speed enforcement data, speed measurement surveys, self-report studies, and naturalistic studies. Attempts have been made to determine the prevalence of speeding in crashes using police reports, but these have conflated inappropriate speed for the conditions with speeding. The objective of the present study was to use data from event data recorders (EDRs) that record pre-crash speed to determine the prevalence and profile of speeding in crashes that occur in South Australia. Data from the Centre for Automotive Safety Research’s Event Data Recorder database (CASR-EDR) was used in the analysis. Separate analyses were conducted for all bullet vehicles (n=319) and for those travelling at a free, or self-selected, speed (n=160). It was found that 27% of bullet vehicles involved in the crash sample were speeding. The most common category of speeding was 1-5 km/h above the speed limit, but 6% of bullet vehicles were found to be speeding by more than 20 km/h prior to their crash. When only free speed vehicles were considered the percentage of vehicles speeding rose to 39%. Speeding was found to be more prevalent in crashes where the bullet vehicle was driven by a young driver, a driver with a provisional license, or the vehicle was black, red, or grey in colour. Speeding was also most prevalent in crashes that occurred on a weekend night, on a curve, at a mid-block location, on a local road, in regional areas, on a wet road, in low-speed zones, and in single vehicle crashes. These findings reinforce the need to reduce the prevalence of speeding through means such as education, enforcement, road design or vehicle technology. Young drivers should be a particular focus of efforts to reduce speeding. The findings can also provide some guidance on where enforcement activities should be further focussed.",,"TRIS, ATRI, USDOT",23-0093,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Australia, Driving behavior, Event data recorders, Speed limits, Speeding, Traffic crashes","Highways, Safety and Human Factors",7/5/2023 1:14:00 PM,7/18/2023 3:15:00 PM,Web,13p,,"Doecke, Sam","Ponte, Giulio","Elsegood, Martin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Figures, References, Tables",2023-00-00,,27th International Technical Conference on the Enhanced Safety of Vehicles (ESV),National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,,,,,,,,,,National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Find a library where document is available,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

Probe-vehicle-based speed data for 1 year was acquired on selected freeway segments to measure the speed effect. A set of fixed-effects linear regression models were used to estimate the effect of speed-reduction treatments on three key speed behavior characteristics—average speed, 90th speed percentiles, and speed variability. Optical speed bars together with speed feedback signs are a promising combination of treatments. While this and other traditional speed-reduction treatments show promise, their influence area is limited to a portion of target road segments.

To combat such significant safety concerns, a speed limit enforcement system has been adopted widely around the world. This study aims to present an econometric approach that estimates the casual effect of speed enforcement on safety while addressing the endogeneity issue by employing an instrumental variable approach within a maximum simulated likelihood framework. In the authors' study, safety enforcement is represented as the number of speeding tickets issued from the speed camera systems, while safety profile is presented as two dimensions of interest, including total crash risk and crashes by injury severity levels. The proposed econometric model takes the form of a correlated panel random parameters model with speed enforcement endogeneity. In estimating the joint panel model, speed enforcement and crash severity components are modeled by employing Random Parameters Ordered Logit Fractional Split technique, while crash risk component is modeled by employing Random Parameters Negative Binomial regression technique. In the current study context, the ‘operational duration of speed camera’ serves as the instrumental variable for controlling the endogeneity between speed enforcement and safety. Further, the analysis is augmented by a detailed policy scenario analysis. The empirical analysis is demonstrated by employing roadway segment-level crash data and speeding tickets data from Queensland, Australia, for the years 2010 through 2013. From the policy analysis, it is found that a stricter speed enforcement for serious level of speeding offenses is likely to have greater safety benefits in reducing crash severity levels. Moreover, a targeted increase in operation duration along with stricter citations for major speeding is likely to have significant safety gain. The outcome of the study will allow the decision-makers to identify a robust resource allocation and speed camera deployment plan.",© 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

For instance, various U.S. states reported an increase in the rate of fatal and severe injury crashes over this duration. In April and May 2020, the comprehensive stay-at-home orders were issued across the country, including in Maine. These orders resulted in drastic reductions in traffic volume. Additionally, there is anecdotal evidence that speed enforcement had been reduced during pandemic. Drivers responded to these changes by increasing their speed. More importantly, data show that speeding continues to occur, even one year after the onset of the pandemic. This study develops statistical models to quantify the impact of the pandemic on speeding in Maine. The authors developed models for three rural facility types (i.e., major collectors, minor arterials, and principal arterials) using a mixed effect Binomial regression model and short duration speed and traffic count data collected at continuous count stations in Maine. The results show that the odds of speeding by more than 15 mph increased by 34% for rural major collectors, 32% for rural minor arterials, and 51% for rural principal arterials (non-Interstates) during the stay-at-home order in April and May of 2020 compared to the same months in 2019. In addition, the odds of speeding by more than 15 mph, in April and May of 2021, one year after the order, were still 27% higher on rural major collectors and 17% higher on rural principal arterials compared to the same months in 2019.",© 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

This study examines the factors influencing Maximum Abbreviated Injury Scale (MAIS) 2+ injuries to belted car drivers using Indian crash data.MethodsCrash data obtained from Road Accident Sampling System–India (RASSI; 2011 to 2020) were used. Analysis was performed on a sample of 662 belted car drivers, representing 1.7 million drivers nationally. Survey logistic regression was used to identify factors influencing the odds of MAIS 2+ injuries to belted car drivers. Factors including delta-V, mass ratio (striking vehicle/struck vehicle), crash type, and driver age and gender were examined. The model fits and the statistical significance of each factor included in the models were examined. In addition, clinical review of crashes with belted drivers sustaining MAIS 3+ injury is presented.ResultsDelta-V was the most significant factor (odds ratio = 12%; 95% confidence interval 6%–19%) influencing belted driver injuries. Older drivers (55+ years) have a higher odds of MAIS 2+ injury. By adding mass ratio to the model, the odds ratio for delta-V increased to 1.16. If the mass ratio is 2.5 (striking vehicle weight = 2.5 times struck vehicle weight), then the odds of MAIS 2+ injury for the struck vehicle driver doubles. The average Delta-V for MAIS 2+ crashes is 34?mph and injury risk increases significantly when delta-V approaches 30?mph. Seventy percent of crashes with injured drivers had a mass ratio &gt;2. For drivers with minor/no injuries, 88% of crashes had a mass ratio &lt;2. Review of MAIS 3+ injury crashes showed that these crashes had a high delta-V (38?mph) and high mass ratio (5). Sixty percent of belted drivers sustained MAIS 3+ head or chest injury resulting from reduction in survival space. About 37% of AIS 3+ head injuries were subdural hemorrhages and 20% were crush injury to head. AIS 3+ chest injuries were rib fractures (40%) and lung lacerations/ruptures (27%).ConclusionDelta-V and mass ratio are significant factors of belted driver injuries in India. Serious injuries are mainly to the head and chest. Increased rear underrun protection device (RUPD) fitment rate, improved airbag and RUPD design, safe speed enforcement, and improved road infrastructure will reduce injury severity.","© 2022 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC 2022.

This study investigates the levels of acceptance and support for different types of speed enforcement, particularly ASE, and the influence of informative statements or suggested ASE policies on levels of acceptance and support among a representative sample of British Columbians. The online survey was conducted by Insights West, a public opinion research firm, in March 2018. Survey respondents were 802 British Columbians, stating their approval of 7 types of speed enforcement and 16 pro-ASE and con-ASE statements on a four-point Likert scale. They were also presented with two informative statements and 11 suggested ASE policies as a six-point Likert scale representing likelihood of support of ASE considering various critical elements. The majority of British Columbians polled demonstrated acceptance and support for the use of ASE technologies in B.C., and strategies designed to foster strong public buy-in for implementation and expansion of ASE technologies were delineated. This survey highlighted the areas which need to be strengthened in order to garner and maintain sufficient community acceptance and support for the ASE program. The findings would be instructive for any jurisdiction that aims to deploy ASE technologies to reduce the burden of preventable transport injuries and deaths.","© 2022 M. Denise Beaton, et al.

1842750,01767981,"Applying the Safe System Approach to Transportation Planning, Design, and Operations in the United States",,PR,English,,,http://apps.trb.org/cmsfeed/TRBNetProjectDisplay.asp?ProjectID=5088,,,Transportation Research Board,,"""Safe System"" has been defined in various ways by the transportation community. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) defined it as ""[t]he basic strategy... to ensure that, in the event of a crash, the impact energies remain below the threshold likely to produce either death or serious injury"" (OECD International Transport Forum, 2008). This definition acknowledges that road users make mistakes. In the Safe Road Transport System Model, safe speeds represent the primary pathway towards a safer system, followed by safe vehicles, safe roads, and safe road users. The Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) explains the Safe System approach as differing from conventional safety practice by ""being human-centered, i.e., seeking safety through a more aggressive use of vehicle or roadway design and operational changes rather than relying primarily on behavioral changes -  and by fully integrating the needs of all users (pedestrians, bicyclists, older, younger, disabled, etc.) of the transportation system"" (https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/safe-systems/).
Literature shows that countries using the Safe System model have outpaced the United States in reducing traffic-related deaths. Some Safe System strategies are included in zero fatality efforts around the United States, such as multidisciplinary implementation to promote safer roads, vehicles, and road users and promote safety culture. Even with increased interest, little guidance exists for transportation planning, design, and operations; policy makers; public health practitioners; and law enforcement for implementing a Safe System. Decision-makers in the transportation community are faced with challenges to adoption and implementation of primary elements of Safe System, such as traditional design processes and legal constraints. 
To be successful and adaptable to future changes, a Safe System approach must address not only infrastructure design but also such factors as vehicle design, policies and laws, recognition of shared safety responsibility, road user behavior, and public culture. For Safe System to be fully implemented, all of these factors need some degree of change. Research is needed to begin providing practical resources for transportation planners, designers, and operations managers to consult during problem identification, project development, and countermeasure selection.
The objectives of this research are the following: 
(1). Identify tools, practices, policies, and prioritization methods that can be tailored for supporting implementation of Safe System at both institutional and project levels.  
(2). Evaluate current Safe System approaches in anticipation of technological advances such as connected and autonomous vehicles (CAV) and automated speed enforcement. 
(3). Identify and document Safe System (a) implementation gaps and challenges in the United States, (b) research needs, and (c) challenges and barriers and remedies thereto.  
(4). Develop practical, data-driven implementation guidelines for Safe System that (a) are scalable to transportation agencies of various sizes and maturities, and (b) consider various road contexts.

In order to devise new strategies to combat this problem there is a continuous search for new approaches from researchers, dealers and government agencies. Recent changes in the Brazilian traffic code, such as the increase of the score limit on the driver qualification and the restrictions on speed enforcement, imposed a new operational scenario. Speeding should increase and, consequently, reflecting more accidents and severity. A proposed model in this work has several equations, correlating road geometry parameters and accident record indexes. This model can be applied as an objective policy tool of physical improvements and speed reduction focusing on accident severity and amount. It was taken the unbalanced centripetal acceleration on horizontal curves as the main derived term, generated mainly by excess of speed in relation to the allowed one, under the Physics and human restrictions criteria. There were selected some Brazilian road segments to apply this model, conceiving specific equations and evaluating confidence under determination coefficient, that resulted a good level to the selected place.","© The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.",TRIS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Brazil, Crash severity, Highway curves, Highway safety, Mathematical models, Speeding, Traffic law enforcement","Highways, Safety and Human Factors",6/29/2022 3:18:00 PM,1/24/2023 9:28:00 AM,Web,pp 837-849,,"Peixoto, Creso de Franco ","Françoso, Maria  Teresa",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,59,,,,,,,,,,,,,References,2022-04-00,Sustainable Civil Infrastructures,18th International Road Federation World Meeting &amp; Exhibition,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Akhnoukh, Amin","Kaloush, Kamil","Elabyad, Magid","Halleman, Brendan","Erian, Nihal","Enmon, Samuel",,,,,Find a library where document is available,,,,,,,,,,9783030798000,,,1,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

Relationships between driving characteristics and safety or emissions have been assessed in multiple studies. However, there is scant information on whether safe driving also reduces emissions and how this relationship changes across urban areas. This study makes use of two similar GPS datasets collected in the metropolitan areas of Toronto and Beijing to conduct a comparative analysis of driving characteristics, speed limit violations, and emissions. Emissions for all trips were computed using the same emission rate database derived from a Portable Emissions Monitoring System (PEMS). The authors observe that the average speeds in the two cities are close to 25 km/h. In Toronto, the fraction of time spent at speeds over 80 km/h on expressways is 40% higher than in Beijing. They also note a higher level of accelerations in Toronto. The trips in Beijing have approximately 14%, 57%, 14%, and 21% lower emissions of carbon dioxide (CO₂), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOₓ), and particle number (PN), respectively. Drivers in Toronto violate speed limits in 93% of their trips for 21% of trip travel time while the numbers for Beijing are 43% and 4%. These differences are not necessarily due to driving behavior, but rather to driving characteristics, which encompass the effects of behavior, road network design, traffic congestion, trip patterns, and speed enforcement. A scenario was evaluated by reconstructing drive-cycles to assess the effects of speed limit enforcement for trips where violations were detected. In Toronto, if obeying the speed limit, the mean trip travel time was estimated to increase by 1.8 min. In contrast, trip emissions of CO₂, CO, NOₓ, and PN were found to decrease, on average, by 5.2%, 19.1%, 5.2%, and 2.9%, respectively. Speed limit enforcement can result in lower emissions, by reducing aggressive accelerations.",© 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

While the law refers to a work zone speed management study, the scope of the study indicates much more than the management of speeds in work zones. The language suggests that the overarching goal of the study is to improve worker safety, with the management of speeds being one of many methods to do so. A Task Force was convened to respond to this request, and HDR Engineering, Inc. was contracted to conduct research and prepare the study. The scope of this study included four main elements: 1) Evaluate existing legal authority for strategies, practices, and methods to reduce vehicle speeds and enhance worker safety in work zones, which may include, but is not limited to, use of traffic control devices, use of barriers, traffic control design modifications, and speed enforcement actions;  2) Propose a process for contractors operating in a work zone that allows contractors to request modifications to a project's traffic control plan, in order to reduce vehicle speeds or improve worker safety in a work zone; 3) Make recommendations on changes to current policies and procedures related to work zone safety; 4) Make recommendations on changes to state law to improve work zone safety. The Task Force jointly evaluated 34 potential improvements to worker safety, and two of the recommendations are related to implementation of a Speed Safety Camera program to manage speeds in work zones. The first recommendation was for an SSC pilot project, and the second recommendation was related to a permanent program. Later, these recommendations were combined because the pilot project must precede a permanent program. Research has indicated public support in Minnesota for the use of Speed Safety Cameras to reduce speeds in work zones or school zones. Research has also found that SSC is effective in reducing speeding behavior; the Federal Highway Administration considers SSC as a proven safety countermeasure in improving safety through speed management. MnDOT and DPS reviewed the Task Force recommendations for the SSC pilot project and refined it to the agencies’ recommendations as listed below. The goal of the SSC pilot project is to validate the parameters and evaluate the effectiveness of the program. This recommendation requires action by the legislature. If the pilot project yielded a successful proof of concept, a permanent SSC program may be pursued. The agencies believe that SSC would be one of the most effective methods to manage speeds in work zones discussed in this study.",,"TRIS, ATRI, STATEDOT",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Highway safety, Minnesota, Road construction workers, Speed limits, Traffic speed, Traffic surveillance, Work zone traffic control","Highways, Operations and Traffic Management, Safety and Human Factors",3/23/2022 11:09:00 AM,3/29/2022 4:52:00 PM,Digital/other,72p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Appendices, Figures, Tables",2022-02-00,,,,,,,,,,,,,"HDR Engineering, Inc.",Minnesota Department of Transportation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

There is a substantial amount of research assessing the effects of different traffic calming measures, even if there is no unanimous evidence for some of them, such as speed cushions (in particular Berlin speed cushions). Some research on speed cushions has been conducted, even if different results were achieved, also varying with the country and context of installation. Moreover, some of these studies are old and they need to be updated, given the continuous transformation of urban environments. In agreement with the City of Bari, thanks to ASSET-Puglia Region funds, the Italian Ministry of Infrastructures and Transport has granted permission to install speed cushions on three urban streets located in restricted speed zones (≤30 km/h) in the City of Bari, to test their effects on vehicular traffic. In this context, this article is aimed at assessing the preliminary results obtained, considering the effects on vehicular speeds. The study design is a typical before-and-after study, in which speeds are measured using a laser speed gun on the three selected road segments before and after the implementation of speed cushions (for each segment, the cushion has a different width). Visual observations were also useful to detect the effects of speed cushions on trajectories and speeds of two-wheeled vehicles. The preliminary analysis of speed profiles revealed a consistent decrease in speed for all the three test sites (in particular the operating speed V85, which is reduced by up to approximately 30%). Moreover, it seems that the decrease in speed is more evident as the cushion width decreases.","© 2021 Nicola Berloco, et al. Published by Elsevier B.V.

A before-and-after evaluation with Empirical Bayes (EB) adjustment was used to account for regression-to-mean bias and other confounding factors. Local safety performance functions and yearly calibration factors were developed using data from a set of reference urban roads. The EB method analysis was utilized to investigate the effect of DFS on different road and intervention types. Results showed significant collision reductions in all scenarios ranging from 31.0% to 41.6%. DFSs were more effective in reducing collisions for arterials compared to collectors. Also, the combined use of DFS and mobile photo enforcement had a slightly higher effect on safety. Initial collision frequencies, traffic volumes, road lengths and the presence of shoulders were found to impact the reduction in collisions for most collision types.","© 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC and The University of Tennessee 2020.

Speed enforcement in rural areas can be difficult due to the expanse of the road network and the limited resources available. Average speed enforcement has proven effective for improving compliance and safety along routes where it is used. Where fixed P2P enforcement is limited to the roads on which it is used, the advent of mobile average speed enforcement technology has the potential to provide more substantial and sustained enforcement activity across the rural road network. The effects of mobile P2P can be expected to be similar to fixed P2P provided they are deployed in a similar fashion (i.e., enforce all lanes and directions of travel, include signage advising drivers), although the magnitude can be expected to be lower due to lower enforcement times. Surveys of automated speed enforcement device manufacturers identified the mobile speed and P2P capabilities currently available. Four options for undertaking mobile P2P were developed based on the survey which were used to identify the potential resources needed to undertake this type of enforcement. Discussions with representatives from DIT and SAPOL identified the potential impact of introducing mobile P2P on current resources. The impact on police resources will vary depending on the method of deployment but in each instance are influenced by the type and number of devices, personnel, and back-end data processing and storage. While the capabilities exist, it is important to trial and evaluate the technology to ensure they are both feasible and effective methods of enforcement.

An MPE program utilizes automated photo radar technology to capture speed limit violators, towards an aim to reduce speeding and thus, improve traffic safety. The authors propose a binary quadratic program that determines where (by location visit tasks) and when (in shifts) to send enforcement resources (operators and equipment) over a month-long schedule. The aim of this program is to minimize violations of enforcement time halos (and thus, efficiency losses) in attaining traffic-safety focused program goals. The authors solved this problem using a combined Dantzig-Wolfe and column generation optimization approach, after exploring several different types of commonly-used solution methods. The model is applied to a currently operational MPE program in the City of Edmonton, Canada. Using a five-day enforcement time halo, the authors find that their model results improve resource utilization by 24% over historical program deployment. The scheduling model is the final step of a larger unified MPE program framework that systematically and efficiently connects high-level urban traffic safety goals down shift-level allocations of highly limited enforcement resources. It provides a data-driven and transparent framework that both contributes to cities’ pursuits of Vision Zero and combatting negative public perceptions of MPE programs. Additionally, the framework can be easily adapted for, and transferred to, other automated traffic enforcement technologies across jurisdictions.",© 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

1850306,01773026,A new model to estimate pedestrian deaths from speed-related interventions,,DO,English,,,https://doi.org/10.1080/15389588.2021.1908544,,,,,"The S-shaped function of probability of pedestrian fatality with respect to impact speed of vehicle is well known in road safety literature. However, the implication of this evidence for changes in speed for a population of drivers has not been explored.  An integrated model has been developed to estimate pedestrian fatalities resulting from changes in speed of traffic. The model uses combined relative risks of injury crash rate of drivers and probability of pedestrian fatality resulting from an injury crash. Two approaches have been used—an individual approach using probability distribution of speed, and an aggregate approach, using only mean speed. The application of the model has been demonstrated using four case studies with speed of traffic before and after an intervention.  It is found that even small reductions in mean speed translate to large reductions in pedestrian fatalities. The risk contributed by speeding vehicles is highly disproportionate to their share in vehicle population. In a case study from Delhi (India), in which at-grade junction was replaced with a grade-separated junction, 74% of risk of pedestrian fatalities is contributed by less than 5% speeding vehicles (> 50km/h). Changes in mean speed is a poor indicator of changes in injury risk if the standard deviation of the distribution also changes significantly. A surprising finding was that large variation in the S-shape of pedestrian fatality risk function has relatively small effects on overall results.  A new model has been developed to estimate changes in pedestrian fatalities resulting from changes in traffic speed. The application of the model using four speed-related interventions emphasize that deterrence of a small proportion of drivers using speed enforcement can have large implications for pedestrian safety.","© 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC 2021.

They hypothesize that the subsequently empty roads may have triggered speed-related traffic violations that caused fatal motor vehicle collisions (MVCs).  In their study, the authors reviewed police data on crash fatalities between January 2010 and February 2020 in which motor vehicle drivers were at fault, then forecasted the numbers of fatal crashes that might be expected during the three-month lockdown period.  The authors found that the actual, observed speed-related fatal crashes were within the 95% confidence intervals of the forecasted numbers.

1691146,01737929,Evaluation of Section Speed Enforcement System Using Empirical Bayes Approach and Turning Point Analysis,,DO,English,,,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/9461483,,,,,"Speeding is a major risk factor for traffic-related injuries. As a countermeasure against speeding, automated speed enforcement systems (ASES) have been deployed in many countries. However, drivers’ awareness of enforcement locations allows themselves to adjust vehicle speeds in the vicinity of the enforcement locations. This enforcement avoidance behavior leads to a criticism of the effectiveness of ASES, in which the system promotes abrupt changes in vehicle speed near enforcement locations, increasing crash risk as a side effect. To address this issue, the section speed enforcement system (SSES), which enforces overspeeding vehicles by their average travel speed over a section, has been devised. In this study, the authors evaluate traffic speed and safety data that were collected from sections with SSES on Korean expressways. The speed analysis showed that the vehicles reduced their speeds inside the enforcement section, and this reduction in speed variations across vehicles was also noticeable, signifying that the risk of traffic crash should be lower. In view of this, the authors have performed before and after comparative analysis using the empirical Bayes method with the comparison group. The outcomes estimate 43% reduction in crash occurrence after installation of SSES. Furthermore, turning point analysis confirmed that the reduction in crash occurrence ensued immediately after installation of SSES.","©2020 Jisup Shim, et al.",TRIS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Automated enforcement, Behavior, Expressways, Korea, Speeding, Traffic law enforcement, Traffic speed","Highways, Operations and Traffic Management, Safety and Human Factors",3/4/2020 9:35:00 AM,4/27/2020 9:07:00 AM,Web,11p,,"Shim, Jisup","Kwon, Oh Hoon","Park, Shin Hyoung","Chung, Sungbong","Jang, Kitae",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Figures, References, Tables",2020-02-00,Journal of Advanced Transportation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Find a library where document is available,,,,,,,,,,,2020,Article ID 9461483,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

1683461,01731210,Factors Affecting Injury Severity of Single-Vehicle Rollover Crashes in the United States,,DO,English,,,https://doi.org/10.1080/15389588.2019.1696962,,,,,"This study investigated the confounding effects of factors on injury outcomes for all occupants in fatal single-vehicle crashes that involved a rollover event. A generalized ordered logit model was used to investigate the role of roadway attributes, environmental factors, driver characteristics, and vehicle features in injury severity outcomes for occupants. Five years of single-vehicle rollover crash data for the United States were studied. Results showed that the likelihood of serious and fatal injuries increases in rollover crashes with partial or complete ejection of the occupant, no seat belt use, speeding, higher posted speed limits, roadside and median rollovers, undulating terrain, blacktop road surface, and rural roads. The authors also found that evening, weekdays, previous driver crash, careless or inattentive driving, driver–passenger engagement, aggressive driving, and vehicle type affect injury severity. The deployment of airbags was associated with fewer serious and fatal injuries. Regional differences were found for injury severity outcomes in rollover crashes. The study provides valuable insight for reducing injury severity in single-vehicle crashes where a rollover occurs. Several proven countermeasures may prevent rollovers or reduce injury severity. These strategies include increasing seatbelt use, posting lower speed limits and installing speed enforcement cameras in high-risk areas, flattening roadside embankments, and promoting in-vehicle stability enhancement systems such as electronic stability control and rollover-activated side curtain airbags.","© 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",TRIS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Countermeasures, Crash analysis, Crash characteristics, Crash injuries, Injury severity, Risk assessment, Rollover crashes, Single vehicle crashes","Highways, Safety and Human Factors",2/7/2020 3:00:00 PM,2/19/2020 5:14:00 PM,Web,pp 66-71,,"Khan, Ihsan  Ullah","Vachal, Kimberly",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,References,2020-01-00,Traffic Injury Prevention,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Find a library where document is available,,,,,,,,,,,21,1,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

Romania’s road fatality rate per 100,000 population has improved overall from a 2008 high of around 15 to the current 2019 value of 9.6. However, the rate has flat-lined with no real improvement for the last decade, stalling at around 9.7 over the period 2011- 2019 and around double the EU rate. Moreover, Romania’s total annual number of road deaths has remained at an average of around 1900 fatalities per annum over this period. Romania has been the worst performing country in the European Union (EU) in recent years, and one of the worst performing countries compared to Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) nations in terms of road safety. The review performed in 2016 found inadequate political leadership and commitment to effective actions to reduce road fatalities, fragmented government road safety activities across a number of regulatory entities, speed limits set at levels that exceed internationally accepted survivable limits, weak traffic law enforcement including a lack of speed enforcement cameras resulting in a failure of drivers to comply with speed limits, and a lack of structured programs to implement human error tolerant road infrastructure constructed according to Safe System principles.

The aim of this study was to empirically test the extent to which Safety Tutor led to a reduction in both total and fatal accidents on Italian highways during the period of 2001–2017. To do so, the authors carried out a generalized difference-in-differences estimation using a unique panel dataset that exploits the heterogeneous accident data within all tolled motorway sectors in a quasi-experimental setting. To deal with the potential endogeneity of the non-random placement of Safety Tutor sites, the authors utilized an instrumental variable strategy by using the network of motorway sectors managed by ASPI and its controlled concessionaires from 2005 onwards (i.e., when the technology was available) as an instrument to predict Safety Tutor adoption. The authors found that a 10% increase in Safety Tutor coverage led to an average reduction in total accidents of 3.9%, whereas there is no evidence of a significant causal effect of Safety Tutor in reducing fatal accidents.",© 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Modeling these types of traffic streams, in which traffic rules (speed limit, lane discipline, etc.) are not strictly followed, is a complex task. A review of the existing literature shows that there is a lack of traffic flow models that model the behavior of heterogeneous and undisciplined traffic streams. Like other undisciplined traffic streams, there are no speed limits (hence no speed enforcement) on most of the roads in Karachi, Pakistan. Lane discipline is also not observed by drivers, which results in a varying number of traffic lanes on a road. Therefore, most of the existing traffic flow models/simulation packages developed for disciplined traffic streams cannot appropriately model traffic streams without lane discipline. This research proposes a width-based cell transmission model (WCTM) by developing a fundamental flow-density diagram whose parameters are a function of the road width. Extensive field data have been collected from a selected arterial in Karachi for development of the fundamental traffic flow diagram. The values of the computed parameters are significantly different than the values reported in the literature. The piecewise-linear flow-density relation is developed by optimally estimating the breakpoints. Results show that the quadrilateral and pentagonal-shaped fundamental diagrams fit better with the collected data in comparison with the triangular-shaped fundamental diagram. The proposed WCTM is applied to selected segments of an arterial and results show that the WCTM was able to accurately model different traffic conditions.",,"TRIS, TRB, ATRI",19-04448,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Arterial highways, Behavior, Developing countries, Drivers, Karachi (Pakistan), Numerical analysis, Traffic density, Traffic flow, Width","Highways, Operations and Traffic Management, Planning and Forecasting",3/4/2019 10:37:00 AM,6/28/2019 3:04:00 PM,Digital/other,pp 682-692,,"Ahmed, Afzal","Ukkusuri, Satish V","Mirza, Shahrukh Raza","Hassan, Ausaja",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Figures, Maps, Photos, References, Tables",2019-05-00,Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Find a library where document is available,,,,,,,,,,,2673,5,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

In each of the twelve surveys conducted in the years 2003 to 2018 attempts were made to survey all of the sites chosen in the stratified random sample of 95 sites in the baseline 2000 survey. In all surveys, seven-day speed data was collected at each site in the sample of roads chosen across the rural network. Each of the surveys resulted in over 1 million vehicles travelling in traffic free-flowing environments. Effectiveness of speed road safety programmes is estimated in terms of changes in speed compliance rates, proportion of drivers exceeding 10 or more km/h above the speed limit, 85th percentile and mean speeds. The results obtained from the speed data analysis in the surveys 2000 to 2018 suggest that speed enforcement strategies should incorporate consideration of differences in driver speed behaviours associated with road type, speed limit, regional and temporal factors.",,"ITRD, ATRI",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Behavior, Driver behaviour, Drivers, Evaluation, Evaluation, Law enforcement, Law enforcement, Road network, Rural area, Rural areas, Speed control, Speed control, Speeding, Speeding, Types of roads by network, Western Australia",Security and Emergencies,12/2/2019 3:43:00 PM,12/2/2019 3:43:00 PM,,62p,,"Sultana, S",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2019-03-00,,,,,,,,,,,,,Road Safety Commission,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

This paper describes a comprehensive site selection model that was used to identify automated speed enforcement sites within the province of British Columbia, Canada. The automated speed enforcement would be complement the existing Intersection Safety Camera (ISC) Program (aka Red-Light Camera Program) and would use the existing camera infrastructure for the new automated speed enforcement program. A total of ten different parameters were developed and included in an analysis-based method for the selection of sites to be considered for automated speed enforcement. Ultimately, not all of the parameters were included in the site selection model, but each parameter is presented in this paper as the excluded parameters could be of interest to other agencies considering or improving automated speed enforcement. The parameters included metrics related to the frequency and severity of collisions, examination of collision types and contributing factors, the potential of the site to improve safety, indices related to vehicle operating speeds including the level of compliance to the posted limit, technical considerations related to the deployment of the technology, spatial considerations including halo effects, and regional equity to ensure that automated speed enforcement would not over-penalize a specific jurisdiction. Another important component of the site selection model was the ability to rank and prioritize locations, such that the most promising locations could be identified. Also including in the model was the ability to weight the different parameters that were included in the model as it was reasonable to expect that not all parameters had the same level of importance. The final component of the site selection model was the capacity to evaluate the road safety investment, ensuring that economic value of reduced collisions was greater than the cost to implement automated speed enforcement at the site.

The number of systems required to fulfil these objectives is quite demanding. These systems may include lighting, fire detection and suppression, ventilation, security and communications, and an overarching Operations Management Control System (OMCS) to ensure the infrastructure is operated in a safe and efficient way. From the tunnel systems’ perspective, it is among the security and communications systems where Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) can be captured (“the all-seeing eye”). Inside the tunnel these systems can include traffic management, traffic data, speed enforcement, emergency phones, Closed Circuit Television (CCTV), Automatic Incident Detection (AID), Public Address and Radio Rebroadcast (PA/RRB). Outside of the tunnel these systems can include advanced traveller information, barrier gates, Over Height Vehicle Detection (OHVD), Hazardous Goods Vehicle Detection and Hot Vehicle Detection (HVD). The main objective of these systems is to provide support to the OMCS and the Tunnel Operators to contribute to an integrated, safe, responsive, and sustainable transport system. These systems are continuously evolving, and new functionalities and solutions are arising in the market. This paper present functionalities that are currently attracting most of the attention (i.e. lane departure system and “Connected Vehicle”). This paper also presents general tunnel operational scenarios and their required management and describes what ITS components are needed to meet operational requirements for each of them. Operational scenarios that will be analysed include: · Normal operating conditions and Planned closures. · Incident Management.·Degraded Modes conditions. Under these operational scenarios, especially those requiring tunnel closure and evacuation (i.e. fire), all tunnel systems need to perform as an integrated system. ITS is crucial and so, traffic management, AID, barrier gates, emergency phones, CCTV, PA/RRB work together with the “traditional” tunnel safety systems such as ventilation, fire suppression and lighting to manage the tunnel in a safe and timely manner.",Abstract reprinted with permission of the World Road Association – PIARC.,TRIS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Fire detection systems, Forecasting, Highway maintenance, Highway operations, Highway safety, Incident management, Intelligent transportation systems, Lighting systems, Security, Tunnels, Ventilation systems","Bridges and other structures, Highways, Maintenance and Preservation, Safety and Human Factors",10/8/2020 11:28:00 AM,2/3/2021 3:00:00 PM,Digital/other,11p,,"Fernandez-Martin, S","Blanco, M","Wazir, N",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Figures, Photos, References, Tables",2019-00-00,,26th World Road Congress,World Road Association (PIARC),,,,,,,,,,World Road Association (PIARC),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

Inappropriate speed is responsible for more than a third of all fatal accidents occurring on roads. In Poland the problem of speeding drivers is widely present. Hence, effective speed management and enforcement of speed limits on existing roads plays an important role. Possible solutions for rural roads are very limited and are focused mainly on administrative speed limitations and speed cameras enforcement. However, due to their limited effectiveness new solutions are still being sought. High expectations are associated with the automatic section speed control system that has recently been introduced in Poland. The aim of this paper is to examine the efficiency of the automatic section speed control system on the basis of speed surveys collected on chosen national roads where the system for sectional speed control was first implemented. Conducted comparisons and statistical analyses included driver’s average speed, speed percentiles, the number of speeding drivers as well as speed heterogeneity.

Vehicle operating speeds and historical crash data were collected at multiple sites with posted speed limits set equal to engineering recommendations and sites with posted speed limits set lower than engineering recommendations. Linear, quantile and logistic regression models were estimated to predict mean operating speed, 85th percentile operating speed and speed limit compliance, respectively, as a function of various roadway characteristics and level of speed enforcement. The Empirical-Bayes before-after approach was also used to develop crash modification factors (CMFs) that describe the expected change in total and fatal + injury crash frequency when setting posted speed limits lower than engineering recommendations. Because safety data were collected over a long time period, temporal adjustments were incorporated to account for yearly changes in crash reporting, traffic characteristics and other variables. The results revealed that speed limit compliance worsened as the difference between the engineering recommended and posted speed limits increased. The presence of verified heavy police enforcement reduced both mean and 85th-percentile operating speeds by approximately 4 mph and increased speed limit compliance. The safety analysis found a statistically significant reduction in total, fatal + injury, and property damage only (PDO) crash frequency at locations with posted speed limits set 5 mph lower than engineering recommendations. Locations with posted speed limits set 10 mph lower than engineering recommendations experienced a decrease in total and PDO crash frequency, but an increase in fatal + injury crash frequency. The safety effects of setting speed limits 15 to 25 mph lower than engineering recommendations were less clear, as the results were not statistically significant, likely due to the small sample of sites included in the evaluation. Overall, the results suggest that setting posted speed limits 5 mph lower than the engineering recommended practice may result in operating speeds that are more consistent with the posted speed limits and overall safety benefits.",© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Police reported crash data for South Australia, Western Australia, Queensland, Victoria and New South Wales and registration data for Victoria and New South Wales for the years 2005 to 2014 were matched with Redbook model types and Road Vehicle Certification Scheme (RVCS) motorcycle characteristic data after decoding models from vehicle identification numbers. These data sources were combined to analyse trends by attributes for injury crashes, registered vehicles and crash rates per registered vehicle. Analysis also considered the odds of a fatal or serious injury outcome given involvement in an injury crash. A unique feature of the study was the ability to study factors affecting crash risk and injury outcomes for motorcyclists related to motorcycle type and other attributes including engine capacity and power to weight ratio. Crash rates and injury outcomes varied significantly by motorcycle type. Furthermore, those motorcycle types with the highest crash risk and highest risk of serious injury outcomes, namely sports motorcycles, are becoming more prevalent in the fleet, which is adversely affecting motorcycle safety. Further adverse effects on motorcycle safety are stemming from the trend to increasing power to weight ratio of newer motorcycles, which has shown a significant association with more severe injury outcomes in a crash. Analysis results also suggest that the effectiveness of the LAMS criteria could also be improved by considering motorcycle type in the restriction criteria.

This paper explores the influence of environmental and road characteristics, situational factors, and individual characteristics on drivers’ observed speed selection in a simulator experiment. The paper presents a theoretical framework for drivers’ speed selection, and applies structural equation modeling for the various factors examined. The simulator experiments collected data of 111 drivers driving in 4 different scenarios composed of 22 segments for each scenario. The dataset was analyzed in several resolutions: Driver level, Trip level, and Segment level. The three models revealed that gender, age, and driving frequency are all significant in determining drivers’ perceptions and attitudes, which in turn influence speed selection. Situational factors such as traffic speed, enforcement, and time-saving-benefits are also related to speed selection, as well as infrastructure characteristics. These findings demonstrate that structural equations provide a flexible modeling tool able to concurrently analyze the variety of factors that relate to speed selection. As a result, Structural Equations Modeling provides more accurate and refined explanations for the combined effects of various factors on drivers’ speed selection than previous research so far. These tools can be useful in developing speed management strategies to improve road safety.",Abstract reprinted with permission of Elsevier.,TRIS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Behavior, Drivers, Driving simulators, Environment, Highway safety, Operating speed, Risk analysis, Speed control, Structural equation modeling","Environment, Highways, Operations and Traffic Management, Safety and Human Factors",5/15/2018 3:49:00 PM,5/22/2018 5:17:00 PM,Web,pp 21-29,,"Sadia, Reut","Bekhor, Shlomo","Polus, Abishai",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Figures, Photos, References, Tables",2018-07-00,Accident Analysis & Prevention,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Find a library where document is available,,,,,,,,,,,116,0,,July 2018,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

An investigation into the effect of police presence, speed awareness training and roadside publicity on drivers’ choice of speed",,DO,English,,,http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/id/eprint/20653,,,ARRB,,"The objective of this research is to develop more effective speed enforcement by investigating the effects of police presence, motorists’ training, and roadside publicity on motorists’ choice of speed. These factors are the most widespread interventions implemented by police all over the world, although only a few have investigated how effective these interventions, in fact, are either as a single or as a combined intervention. This study was conducted in Indonesian road and applied a factorial experiment design where police, training and publicity were operated as the intervention factors. Further, a traffic survey and questionnaires for motorists and police officers were utilized to support the study’s results. A survey of motorists shows that they are aware of the consequences of speeding, although prefer softer approaches to handle it, while a survey of police forces shows a high level of satisfaction for existing measures, including the new proposed speed enforcement program. One important finding of this research is the discovery of a three-way interaction effect on dual carriageways, which means that the addition of training and publicity to police interventions increases the effectiveness of speed enforcement. However, on single carriageways, the only significant effect was produced by the police presence. Surprisingly, the training as the single factor has increased travel speeds on dual carriageways, although the effect has changed drastically when combined with police and roadside publicity. Finally, the result shows that there is potential for further development of speed enforcement programs by combining training and roadside publicity into police enforcement. In addition, this study also proposes a number of policies so that enforcement agencies can increase the effectiveness police enforcement.",PhD thesis,ATRI,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Behavior, Driver behaviour, Driver education, Driver education, Drivers, Indonesia, Law enforcement, Law enforcement, Police, Police, Publicity, Publicity, Questionnaire, Questionnaires, Road type, Speed limit, Speed limits, Types of roads",Security and Emergencies,9/24/2018 11:53:00 AM,9/24/2018 11:53:00 AM,,1 file,,"Siregar, A A",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2018-06-00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

Speed data were collected in six different work zone locations in northern and southern California and used to determine the magnitude and nature of speeding problem in highway work zones. In addition data were collected over 11 test-days in four work zones with four levels of police presence: radar speed display with police decal and lighting, passive use of a police vehicle with radar speed display, passive use of a police vehicle without radar speed display, and active police speed enforcement near work zones. This paper analyzes this data using statistical methods to evaluate the effectiveness of these different methods of speed control on the safety of the work zone.

The non-contact optical speed sensor and the GPS speed sensor are the two most common types of standard speed-measuring instruments. The non-contact optical speed sensor requires extremely high installation accuracy, and its speed-measuring error is nonlinear and uncorrectable. The speed-measuring accuracy of the GPS speed sensor is rapidly reduced if the amount of received satellites is insufficient enough, which often occurs in urban high-rise regions, tunnels, and mountainous regions. In this paper, a new standard speed-measuring instrument using a dual-antenna Doppler radar sensor is proposed based on a tradeoff between the installation accuracy requirement and the usage region limitation, which has no specified requirements for its mounting distance and no limitation on usage regions and can automatically compensate for the effect of an inclined installation angle on its speed-measuring accuracy. Theoretical model analysis, simulated speed measurement results, and field experimental results compared with a GPS speed sensor with high accuracy showed that the dual-antenna Doppler radar sensor is effective and reliable as a new standard speed-measuring instrument.","© 2018 Lei Du, et al.",TRIS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Doppler radar, Sensors, Speed measurement, Traffic law enforcement, Traffic speed, Traffic speed measurement","Data and Information Technology, Highways, Operations and Traffic Management",4/26/2018 12:05:00 PM,6/19/2018 9:34:00 AM,Web,19p,,"Du, Lei","Sun, Qiao","Cai, Changqing","Bai, Jie","Fan, Zhe","Zhang, Yue",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Figures, Photos, References, Tables",2018-04-00,Sensors,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Find a library where document is available,,,,,,,,,,,18,4,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

In this study, a driving simulator (STISIM) was used to explore drivers' speed choices, and how they are influenced by infrastructure, traffic, risk/benefit, and driver characteristics. Drivers also filled out a stated-preference survey, which included speed selection items and demographic characteristics. The experimental design included four scenarios of a specific risk or benefit to the driver: A daily trip, a higher speed enforcement scenario, a higher crash-risk scenario, and a scenario with high time pressure. The driver sample included 111 drivers from different ages between 20 and 65, with 44% women. The database included 9,768 observations. The largest effect on drivers' speed was under time-saving benefits with an average increase of 10 km/hr. Infrastructure effects included horizontal curves, longitudinal slope changes, and design speed. Age and gender also influenced speed selection. Thus, the most effective measures for speed reduction may be (1) enforcement, (2) design speed, and (3) horizontal curves, in contrast to (1) time-saving benefits and (2) a high average speed of close-by vehicles, which motivated drivers to increase their speed but may be reduced by counteracting policies.","© 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC and The University of Tennessee.

The guidelines are based on an analysis of vehicle speeds and trajectories that were obtained with a speed gun and a video recording method at six expressway tollgates in Korea. From the analysis results, two risk factors for the operation of the ETC systems were identified: speed differences between ETC-tagged vehicles and other vehicles with respect to locations, and lane changes as a result of entering the wrong lane. The guidelines suggest a method to calculate the safe distance necessary for lane changing and a lane configuration method to reduce accident risks resulting from speed variance. Although the guidelines are based on a case study in Korea, the approach could be useful for operation agencies of other ETC systems in strategic planning to reduce accident risks.","© Iran University of Science and Technology 2018.

To explore this dilemma, this project attempts to ascertain whether there is a relationship between state speed laws, roadway fatality rates, and public perceptions of speed. Better data are needed for definitive conclusions to be made regarding a possible relationship between these three bodies of knowledge.This report suggests that by improving data on the role of speed in crashes and public perceptions regarding speed, developing a standard measurement of speed law enforcement in each state, and adopting more consistent speed laws across states, a virtuous cycle can be initiated that helps dismantle the public choice problem, thus enabling the establishment of more effective speed enforcement regimes throughout the U.S.","This document was sponsored by the U.S. Department of Transportation, University Transportation Centers Program.","UTC, NTL, TRIS, ATRI, USDOT",CTS 18-02,,,,,,,,,,DTRT13-G-UTC35,,,,,,,,,,"Crash rates, Fatalities, Highway safety, Public opinion, Speed limits, Speeding, State laws, Traffic regulations, Traffic safety, Traffic speed","Highways, Law, Operations and Traffic Management, Safety and Human Factors",3/12/2018 2:22:00 PM,3/21/2018 10:12:00 AM,Digital/other,33p,,"Douma, Frank","Alarcon, Frank",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Appendices, Figures, References, Tables",2018-02-00,,,,,,,,,,,,,University of Minnesota,"University of Minnesota, Twin Cities",Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Final Report,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

The main task of the application was to measure the average speeds of motorized vehicles for traffic enforcement and speed control purposes. The objective of the study was to evaluate the speeding and violation behaviors on 11 different sections in the Akdeniz University campus located at the city of Antalya in Turkey in the direction of speed limits provided as 20, 30 and 50 km/h by way of only signs, warning and announcements without any penal sanctions. P2P speed enforcement was declared to the drivers prior to the application for measuring the 2 month average travel speeds of vehicles passing through the application sections which were then subject to an analysis. It has been observed as a result of the speeding study that the section preferences of drivers differ according to the different physical properties. The ratio of violating vehicles was 63.01%, whereas the ratio of vehicles that comply with the speed limits was 36.99%.

Moreover, unlike unidirectional arterials, bidirectional arterials with short intersection spacing are not amenable to green waves that can remove the incentive to speed. This research explores the ways that traffic signal coordination creates – or limits – speeding opportunities on bidirectional arterials. Two measures of speeding opportunity are proposed: number of unconstrained vehicles, meaning vehicles arriving at a stopline on green and with no vehicle less than 5 s ahead of them, and number of speeders in a traffic microsimulation in which 20% of the vehicles have been assigned a desired speed in the “speeding” range. Theoretical analysis, confirmed by two case studies, show how speeding opportunities are related to degree of saturation, cycle length, specified progression speed (as in input to signal timing software), intersection spacing, and recall settings. The important role of clusters of intersections with near-simultaneous greens, a byproduct of bidirectional coordination with short intersection spacing, is examined. Clusters with many intersections are shown to create a strong speeding incentive, and cluster size can be reduced by lowering the cycle length and the progression speed. Case studies show it is sometimes possible to substantially reduce speeding opportunities with little or no increase in vehicular delay by lowering cycle length, lowering progression speed, dividing an arterial into smaller “coordination zones” with each zone having its own cycle length, and by abandoning coordination altogether.",,"TRIS, TRB, ATRI",18-04160,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Arterial highways, Bi-directional traffic flow, Boston (Massachusetts), Case studies, Green interval (Traffic signal cycle), Microsimulation, Signalized intersections, Speeding, Traffic signal control systems, Traffic signal cycle, Traffic speed, Urban areas","Highways, Operations and Traffic Management, Planning and Forecasting",1/8/2018 11:01:00 AM,5/24/2019 3:06:00 PM,Print,pp 107-116,,"Furth, Peter G","Halawani, Ahmed T.

This study identified circumstances under which the largest increases in deaths occurred during this period. Annual counts of U.S. pedestrian fatalities and crash involvements were extracted from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System and General Estimates System. Poisson regression examined if pedestrian fatalities by various roadway, environmental, personal, and vehicle factors changed significantly during 2009–2016. Linear regression examined changes over the study period in pedestrian deaths per 100 crash involvements and in horsepower per 1,000 pounds of weight among passenger vehicles involved in fatal single-vehicle pedestrian crashes. Pedestrian deaths per 100 crash involvements increased 29% from 2010, when they reached their lowest point, to 2015, the most recent year for which crash involvement data were available. The largest increases in pedestrian deaths during 2009–2016 occurred in urban areas (54% increase from 2009 to 2016), on arterials (67% increase), at nonintersections (50% increase), and in dark conditions (56% increase). The rise in the number of SUVs involved in fatal single-vehicle pedestrian crashes (82% increase) was larger than the increases in the number of cars, vans, pickups, or medium/heavy trucks involved in these crashes. The power of passenger vehicles involved in fatal single-vehicle pedestrian crashes increased over the study period, with larger increases in vehicle power among more powerful vehicles. Efforts to turn back the recent increase in pedestrian fatalities should focus on the conditions where the rise has been the greatest. Transportation agencies can improve urban arterials by investing in proven countermeasures, such as road diets, median crossing islands, pedestrian hybrid beacons, and automated speed enforcement.

Initially exploring the detrimental consequences of drivers running red lights and speeding, the paper will define automated enforcement systems, the impact these systems have, the issues they raise, the question of legality and the ongoing battle of public perception. Using this information, it will explore the implications that automated enforcement systems can have on pedestrian and bicycle safety. The final section discusses how automated enforcement systems should be seen as one potential tool to aid crash prevention, rather than a comprehensive and final solution. It also cautions against the implementation of automated enforcement systems primarily for the generation of revenue. Seeing the systems as part of a broader campaign to make streets and intersections safer is the best way to prevent  legal challenges, and garner public support, so automated systems can achieve their intended purpose of preventing traffic crashes and saving lives.","Prepared by Bryan Poole in December 2012, and updated by Sarah Johnson and Libby Thomas

1482520,01646082,Speed Limits in England,,DO,English,,,http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN00468/SN00468.pdf,/common/images/covers/large/1482520.png,,,,"This paper sets out the legislation and guidance on speed limits and how highways authorities can vary limits in their areas. It also explains policy towards 20 mph, motorway and rural speed limits and how speed limits are enforced. Finally, it summarises the policies of successive governments towards speed limits. In built up areas the general speed limit is 30mph; on single carriageway roads it is 60 mph and on dual carriageways, 70 mph. However, highway authorities have the power to vary the speed limits on the roads they control – for example in urban areas, particularly around schools, there has been a growing trend for local highway authorities to reduce the limit to 20 mph. Similarly single and dual carriageways often have a lower limit than that indicated above – particularly as they approach heavily populated areas. In January 2013 the Department for Transport published revised guidelines to local highway authorities on the setting of speed limits. Broadly this reiterated pre-existing policy, emphasising the options available to local authorities to introduce 20 mph limits in urban areas and to assess speed limits in rural areas based on safety criteria. It also launched a new speed limit appraisal tool for local authorities. At the same time the police speed enforcement guidelines were republished. These remain in force. Speed limits are enforced by road traffic police and automated detection devices such as speed cameras. Penalties can range from a Fixed Penalty Notice of £100 and three points on the licence to a £1,000 fine and a disqualification. Drivers may be offered the alternative of a speed awareness course. Since 2010 Conservative-led governments have debated whether the speed limits on motorways should be increased to 80 mph, but there was no formal consultation on this and it is not now Government policy. Please note that this paper applies to England only, this is now a devolved matter across the rest of the UK: there are links to the relevant legislation and guidance for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland in the appropriate sections.",Contains Parliamentary information licensed under the Open Parliament Licence v3.0.,TRIS,CBP00468,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"England, Highway departments, Legislation, Policy, Rural areas, Speed limits, Traffic law enforcement, Urban areas","Highways, Law, Operations and Traffic Management, Policy",9/12/2017 10:42:00 AM,9/15/2017 10:39:00 AM,Digital/other,26p,,"Butcher, Louise",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"References, Tables",2017-08-30,,,,,,,,,,,,,House of Commons Library,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Briefing Paper,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

This project used surveys and interviews to better understand public rejection of ASE and to strategically provide individualized information to determine whether opinions can be shifted toward a more favorable view of ASE. Statistically significant movement on ASE opinion was achieved after respondents engaged with a tailored survey addressing their particular ASE concerns. Those who changed their opinion were more engaged (e.g., considered the opposite of their current stance more fully) and were persuaded by evidence of safety benefits resulting from reduced speeds and effective speed reduction with ASE deployment.","This document was sponsored by the U.S. Department of Transportation, University Transportation Centers Program.","UTC, NTL, TRIS, ATRI, USDOT",CTS 17-03,,,,,,,,,,DTRT13-G-UTC35,,,,,,,,,,"Automated enforcement, Countermeasures, Highway safety, Speeding, Stakeholders, Traffic law enforcement","Highways, Operations and Traffic Management, Safety and Human Factors",6/27/2017 2:37:00 PM,7/17/2017 9:33:00 AM,Digital/other,59p,,"Peterson, Colleen","Douma, Frank","Morris, Nichole L",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Appendices, Figures, Photos, References, Tables",2017-05-00,,,,,,,,,,,,,University of Minnesota,"University of Minnesota, Twin Cities",Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,National Technical Information Service,,,,,,,,,,,,,Final Report,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

However, most previous research focuses mainly on validating the safety effects of MPE, with very minimal discussion on the enforcement performance indicators (EPIs). Therefore, the goal of this study is to provide a better understanding of the relationship between the three selected EPIs (number of enforced sites, average check length, and number of issued tickets) and the program's safety outcomes. In total, 8 years (2005–2012) of monthly citywide data were collected and used in a generalized linear Poisson model. The results show that as the number of enforced sites and issued tickets increased, the number of speed-related collisions decreased. Also, as the average check length decreased, a greater reduction of speed-related collisions was observed. These results indicate that collision reductions were associated with a MPE program that promoted: higher spatial coverage (i.e., more enforceable locations), more frequent checks (i.e., shorter average check length), and more issued tickets.

Stemming from deterrence theory (Gibbs, 1985; Homel, 1988) the factors of “celerity”, “certainty”, and “severity” of the sanction were explored as a function of type of speed enforcement (automatic radars vs. police officers) and knowledge of enforcement location (known vs. unknown). Coping factors (e.g., self-efficacy, response cost) from protection motivation theory (PMT; Rogers, 1983) were also considered as critical variables of compliance. Participants (245 students, 51% men) had to choose their speed behavior in a mental simulation of a driving episode on a freeway. As expected, the intention to speed was lower when speed-enforcement warning messages were announced than in the control situation. Threat-certainty ratings were higher when automatic radars were announced, but speeding intentions did not vary according to the automatic versus human type of speed enforcement. Furthermore, automatic radars were perceived as easier to cope with in a maladaptive way (i.e., self-efficacy for avoiding a sanction and adapting speed as a function of speed-enforcement location). An unknown speed-enforcement location was one way of decreasing both women’s and men’s speed. Men calculated a cost-benefit balance to avoid slowing down when they knew the enforcement location.

Recent technological developments enable a wide range of alternative traffic monitoring possibilities. In particular, the availability of cellular and GPS devices creates the opportunity to utilize probe vehicle data. To date, most studies using probe vehicle data focused on operational purposes such as congestion identification, relying primarily on average speeds. Probe vehicle data can also be useful for safety studies. The data is often collected continuously (24/7, 365 days a year). It can therefore enable detailed analyses of the continuous changes in speed over time. In addition, the spatial coverage of the data enables continuous evaluation of the halo effect of speed enforcement installation, compared with a relatively small number of measurement sites (e.g. 3–5) in traditional methods. Probe vehicle data offer one more advantage: When performing a before-after study, the before measurements have to be performed before camera installation. However, installation plans may change, and therefore conducting the before measurements may be administratively challenging. Probe vehicle data, especially if collected continuously, regardless of research needs, enable researchers to choose the desired sites and times for analysis in retrospect, after the cameras have been installed. The purpose of this paper is to describe the results obtained from analysis of probe vehicle data on the effect of speed enforcement cameras that were installed at non-urban roads in Israel during 2011–2013. In addition to the contribution regarding the impact of enforcement cameras, the paper demonstrates the potential (as well as the challenges) of using probe vehicle data for safety studies. The analyses in this paper consider 22 installation sites and 12 comparison sites. The results show that at the installation sites (within 100 m), the 85th percentile speeds exhibited a short-term (two months) reduction of 2.92 km/h (SD = 2.37) and a long-term (one year) reduction of 6.48 km/h (SD = 3.5).

The goal of this paper was to scientifically evaluate frequently used field set-ups. The following set-ups were tested in one week: (1) police unit 1: speed control with and without a static feedback sign placed after the control; (2) police unit 2: speed control with and without a digital feedback sign placed after the control; (3) police unit 3: speed display followed by a second speed display further along the road section. During certain time frames, speed control took place in between both signs. All tested field set-ups generated significant reductions in the speed level. Studying the effect of the different variations for each set-up reveals that the effect of the speed control is generally larger in combination with the signage alongside the road. After the period during which the police activities took place, speed levels again reached their initial level.

Accordingly, it has been argued that stricter speed enforcement thresholds could further improve road safety. Effective speed monitoring however requires driver attention and effort, and human information-processing capacity is limited. Emphasizing speed monitoring may therefore reduce resource availability for other aspects of safe vehicle operation. The authors investigated whether lowering enforcement thresholds in a simulator setting would introduce further competition for limited cognitive and visual resources. Eighty-four young adult participants drove under conditions where they could be fined for travelling 1, 6, or 11 km/h over a 50 km/h speed-limit. Stricter speed enforcement led to greater subjective workload and significant decrements in peripheral object detection. These data indicate that the benefits of reduced speeding with stricter enforcement may be at least partially offset by greater mental demands on drivers, reducing their responses to safety-critical stimuli on the road. It is likely these results under-estimate the impact of stricter speed enforcement on real-world drivers who experience significantly greater pressures to drive at or above the speed limit.",Abstract reprinted with permission of Elsevier.,TRIS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Attention, Hazards, Highway safety, Law enforcement, Speed limits, Speeding","Highways, Operations and Traffic Management, Safety and Human Factors",12/16/2016 2:40:00 PM,12/21/2016 11:34:00 AM,Web,pp 118-122,,"Bowden, Vanessa K","Loft, Shayne","Tatasciore, Monica","Visser, Troy A W",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Figures, Photos, References, Tables",2017-01-00,Accident Analysis & Prevention,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Find a library where document is available,,,,,,,,,,,98,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

Understanding how drivers behave towards speed management devices (i.e., speed cameras, radars, speed limits and speed warning signs) as well as factors affecting drivers’ involvement in speed-related crashes might help in improving traffic safety.  This study aims to identify and quantify the factors that affect drivers’ compliance with speed enforcement and management devices as well as drivers’ involvement in at-fault speed-related crashes in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi (AD), UAE.  Two different datasets were collected from the same drivers’ population in AD to provide different valuable information regarding the speeding problem. The first dataset was obtained from crashes’ reports while, the second dataset was obtained from a self-reported questionnaire survey that was carried out among a total of 442 drivers in AD.  Three logistic regression models were developed to identify the significant variables that affect (1) the occurrence of speed related crash (using crashes reports data), (2) drivers’ compliance with speed limits (using questionnaire data), and (3) involvement in at-fault speed related crashes (using questionnaire data).  The findings revealed that drivers’ factors (gender, age, and nationality), vehicle factor (vehicle type), roads and environment factors (weather, road type and speed limit) were the significant factors that affect the occurrence of speed-related crashes in AD. The questionnaire findings revealed that running late, low values of posted speed limits and no sufficient police enforcement were the three main reasons that make motorists drive over the speed limits. In addition, the results indicated that drivers’ characteristics (i.e., gender, education and income), drivers’ responses to speed enforcement and management devices, and drivers’ awareness about the importance of such devices in improving traffic safety were the main factors that affecting both drivers’ compliance with speed enforcement devices and drivers’ involvement in at-fault speed-related crashes.

GHSO selects local agencies to receive funding which is 100% federally funded to participate in the program using criteria such as county-wide crash data, available funding levels, etc. However, the current GHSO approach does not have a clear funding and ranking criteria that takes into consideration the variability in population, traffic exposure, jurisdiction size, and other factors that differentiate one agency to others. This paper starts with a detailed literature review on traffic enforcement funding allocation methodologies as experienced from selected states across US. The study then establishes traffic enforcement ranking and funding criteria that take into account several variables in making annual determinations regarding grant allocations. The developed funding allocation formula ensures that counties are compared on a relative basis by normalizing the variables to the highest value among the counties being considered for funding. The variables considered included county crashes (Equivalent Property Damage Only [EPDO] weighted crashes, injury severities, alcohol related, speeding related and motorcycle related), population,  vehicle miles of travel (VMT), and the crashes involving young and senior drivers.

One type of sensor was designed for improving safety in dilemma zones at signalized intersections. Although it does not have the capability to differentiate between lanes, it has a detection range of up to 600 ft. and the capability to track vehicles approaching the intersection. UDOT desired to use this capability to get added value from their investment by collecting approach volume and speed data from the sensor. In this study the accuracy of approach speeds collected by this sensor was evaluated by comparing sensor data to ground truth data collected by a LiDAR gun with two factors in mind: the number of approach lanes and offset position of the lanes relative to the location of the speed gun. The t-test of means showed that the difference in mean accuracy values was statistically significant at some sites and not significant at other sites. However, the difference was only within ±2.0 mph and not significant for practical use. As for the 85th percentile speeds, the average difference of 85th percentile speeds was -0.43 mph for the sites with more than 50 samples. To compensate for the relatively small number of 85th percentile speed data, the bootstrapping method was performed. This analysis showed that the 85th percentile speeds by the two methods were not significantly different for practical use, their differences being just within 18 ±2.0 mph.",This paper was sponsored by TRB committee ABJ35 Standing Committee on Highway Traffic Monitoring.,"PRP, TRIS, TRB, ATRI",17-00656,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85th percentile speed, Accuracy, Laser radar, Mean (Statistics), Microwave detectors, Traffic data, Traffic speed, Traffic volume","Data and Information Technology, Highways, Operations and Traffic Management",12/8/2016 10:08:00 AM,1/24/2017 12:03:00 PM,Digital/other,17p,,"Sanchez, Gregory H","Saito, Mitsuru","Schultz, Grant G","Eggett, Dennis L",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Figures, References, Tables",2017-00-00,,Transportation Research Board 96th Annual Meeting,Transportation Research Board,,,,,,,,,,Transportation Research Board,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

Many results of studies showed that the implementation of speed cameras significantly reduced the vehicle speed and the number of accidents near camera sites. One issue regarding speed enforcement by a speed camera is that a reduction in speed is obtained only on a short section of a road. The results of scientific research analysis suggest that this issue can be overcome by the employment of average speed enforcement system (hereafter system), which is a relatively new approach to traffic law enforcement.

The analysis of international practice helped to develop this model, which joins accident indicators, road and traffic parameters.

1484983,01648161,Progressive penalty system and road safety; Estimated safety effects of progressive fines for repeated speeding offences.,"Progressief boetestelsel en verkeersveiligheid : geschatte veiligheidseffecten van hogere boetes bij herhaalde snelheidsovertredingen. In opdracht van het Ministerie van Justitie, Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek- en Documentatiecentrum WODC.",DO,,,,https://www.swov.nl/publicatie/progressief-boetestelsel-en-verkeersveiligheid,,,"Institute for Road Safety, SWOV",C 51802 [electronic version only],"A traffic offence is typically more heavily penalized if it comes with a greater risk. As one exceeds the limit — for driving speed or blood alcohol content — to a greater extent, the fine one gets is higher. Repeat offences also lead to a significantly higher risk. However, most repeat offences in the Netherlands do not lead to higher fines at present, because they are licence plate-based. At this moment, the ‘Administrative law enforcement traffic regulations’ (WAHV, also called 'Mulder Law'), does not allow this. Dutch Parliament (motion 471, 2 July 2015), asked the Minister of Security and Justice to investigate options for a progressive penalty system in which the fine increases in the case of repeat offences. The Ministry’s Research and Documentation Centre (WODC) asked SWOV to carry out part of that investigation, namely an estimation of the road safety effect of a progressive fine system for speeding offences. Furthermore, SWOV investigated whether evidence could be found for the assumptions and mechanisms on which a progressive fine system is based, and whether such a system has possible (unintended) side effects. This report presents the results of this study. Calculations are based on licence plate-based fines, as in 2016 96% of all WAHV-offences were ‘automatically’ registered (licence liability) and 84% concerned a speeding offence, mainly by delivery vehicles and cars. It has been established that three assumptions underlie the desire to achieve a progressive fine system: 1) there is a relation between driving speed and road safety, 2) there is a relation between repeat speeding offencesand road safety and 3) there is a relation between the height of fines and road safety. Taken together, these three consitute the mechanism of action. Literature research indicates that there is evidence for these assumptions. Driving speed influences injury severity and the probability of a crash. Repeat speeding offences also have influence on the risk of crashes: vehicles that have received multiple (speeding) fines, have been found to have a (significantly) higher risk of crashes. The crash risk of vehicles with one fine is similar to that of vehicles that have not been fined at all, but the risk of vehicles with two fines per year is twice as high. The relative risk increases rapidly: the risk at three fines is more than five times higher, at four fines it is eleven times higher and at five or more fines it even reaches 35 times higher. A measure that results in fewer repeat speeding offences is expected to have a considerable positive effect on the number of crashes. Several studies indicate that a higher fine usually leads to behavioural changes, but the relationship between the fine increase and speed behaviour (the price elasticity) is inconclusive. Based on the literature, the present study is based on a best estimate of -0.2 held. This means that each percentage of fine increase results in 0.2% fewer offences. Because fewer offences lead to a lower risk, the number of crashes will decrease. Sufficient social support is necessary to make a progressive fine system successful. Research shows that there still is broad support for the current (speed) enforcement system in the Netherlands. Although a progressive fine system has not yet been introduced, we do know something about the view of interest groups in the field of traffic and road safety. They are either favour of such a system (60%), or they are neutral about it (40%). Other than social support, the risk of being fined and, consequently, the enforcement level, is essential for the success of a progressive fine system. We estimate that, at present, the average vehicle receives one fine for speeding per 4,000 km of driving (far) over the speed limit. Nevertheless, in recent years the licence plate-based apprehension rate in the Netherlands was the highest of Europe (calculated per inhabitant). Not only the objective apprehension risk is important, but the subjective apprehension risk also plays an important role. When people estimate the risk of being fined for a traffic offence to be low, the height of the fine will have little influence on their behaviour. Many road users in Netherlands consider the risk of being fined for speeding to be high. At present, both conditions, sufficient social support and a high enough (subjective) risk of being fined, therefore seem te be met in the Netherlands. Two types of side-effect of a progressive fine system are to be expected. The first is a change in the penalty system at the expense of the intrinsic motivation (do something because it gives you satisfaction). There is a risk that a change of the fine system leads to more extrinsic motivation, i.e. drivers mainly keeping to the limit to avoid a (higher) fine and not because they find it important. That could lead to a lower actual compliance with the limits. Since this same objection applies to the current penalty system, a progressive fine system will not necessarily cause an increase in extrensic motivation compared to the current fine system. Concerning the motivation, it is also possible that a progressive fine system will have a positive effect on the ‘signal ' function of a traffic fine, for example because the progressive penalty system focuses attention on the (small) group of repeat offenders, a group one may not want to belong to. This possible signal function needs to be investigated. In advance it is unclear which effect on the motivation will be stronger. The second side effect is that of payment problems which may arise among offenders. We consider that possibility to be realistic. Beside their social impact, payment problems may result in people becoming insensitive to fine increases and not adjusting their behaviour. It is therefore recommended to implement a more personal approach after a yet to be determined number of fines. This may be in the form of a telephone call, a visit of a police officer or the installation of a speed lock (ISA). In consultation with the advisory committee of this research, the effects of two variants of a progressive fine system have been calculated. In the first variant the fine increase ranges from 25% (for the second fine) to 100% (from the fifth fine). The second variant has a stronger increase but has a lower first fine compared to the current level. In this second variant the maximum fine increase amounts to150% from the fifth penalty onwards. The main conclusion is that a progressive fine system could result in about 30 (5%) fewer road deaths and 400 fewer serious road injuries (2%). This would also reduce the social costs of road crashes by a few percentage points. The social benefit-cost ratio of a progressive fine system can be very high, depending on the administrative costs of the measure. The change in behaviour of a small group of multiple offenders (ca. 1% of all vehicles) is crucial for this effect, but it is not certain how large this change will actually be.

In 2009, the state speed camera law increased the enforcement threshold from 11 to 12 mph over the speed limit and restricted school zone enforcement hours. In 2012, the county began using a corridor approach, in which cameras were periodically moved along the length of a roadway segment. The long-term effects of the speed camera program on travel speeds, public attitudes, and crashes were evaluated.   Changes in travel speeds at camera sites from 6 months before the program began to 7½ years after were compared with changes in speeds at control sites in the nearby Virginia counties of Fairfax and Arlington. A telephone survey of Montgomery County drivers was conducted in Fall 2014 to examine attitudes and experiences related to automated speed enforcement. Using data on crashes during 2004–2013, logistic regression models examined the program's effects on the likelihood that a crash involved an incapacitating or fatal injury on camera-eligible roads and on potential spillover roads in Montgomery County, using crashes in Fairfax County on similar roads as controls.   About 7½ years after the program began, speed cameras were associated with a 10% reduction in mean speeds and a 62% reduction in the likelihood that a vehicle was traveling more than 10 mph above the speed limit at camera sites. When interviewed in Fall 2014, 95% of drivers were aware of the camera program, 62% favored it, and most had received a camera ticket or knew someone else who had. The overall effect of the camera program in its modified form, including both the law change and the corridor approach, was a 39% reduction in the likelihood that a crash resulted in an incapacitating or fatal injury. Speed cameras alone were associated with a 19% reduction in the likelihood that a crash resulted in an incapacitating or fatal injury, the law change was associated with a nonsignificant 8% increase, and the corridor approach provided an additional 30% reduction over and above the cameras.

This has inevitably resulted in substantial growth in traffic volumes and sometimes even a fast-paced, competitive lifestyle. Unfortunately, a possible consequence is more and more unsafe driving, particularly in areas where congestion is an issue. Legislators are often placed in the difficult position of having to ensure the safety of the driving public through unpopular legislation, such as red light cameras and automated speed enforcement. Likewise, the general public often does not fully understand the reasoning behind such legislation, assuming that lawmakers are simply trying to increase revenue for government spending, and not truly just trying to keep the public safe.

This project will initially serve as a proof of concept and will provide legislators, law enforcement, and the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) with actual footage of dangerous events at known problem areas across Raleigh, North Carolina. Having a database of specific events at intersections and road segments across the capital city will provide legislators a tool with which to educate the general public when legislation is being considered that is unpopular to citizens of the state.

The ideal indicator on how to assess the level of enforcement of speeding would be to compare countries on the basis of time spent on speed enforcement or checks performed both by the police and by safety camera (e.g. GoSafe, the service provider contracted by the Irish Police, has to provide a minimum of 72,000 hours of speed enforcement per year). Unfortunately this indicator is not available in most other countries. This report uses the number of tickets per thousand inhabitants, assuming that they are broadly proportionate to the level of enforcement activity.

Hence, in the model, the same set of variables can be used to determine both the mean value and the standard deviation of the speed distribution; the desired speed percentile is then calculated by considering the associated standard normal random variable (Z).

The Advance sensor is primarily designed for dilemma zone reduction. It does not have the capability to differentiate vehicles between lanes, but the Advance sensor currently used has a detection range of up to 600 ft. and has the capability to track vehicles approaching the intersection. UDOT wanted to use this capability to get added values from their investment in the Advance sensors. The approach volume accuracy was analyzed with three factors: sensor position, number of approach lanes, and approach volume level. The results showed that the high accuracy is achieved when the number of approach lanes is low, or closer to one-lane, and the approach volume level is low. The overall range of accuracy for the approach volume counts was found to range from approximately 77.8% (22.2% undercount) to 105.7% (5.7% overcount). The accuracy of approach speeds was analyzed with two factors: the number of lanes and offset position of the lanes relative to the location of the speed gun. The offset position was first tested and found not to affect the accuracy of approach speeds. In general, the difference in means was approximately ±2 mph and was not considered practically significant. The 85th percentile speed for sites with more than 50 samples were then evaluated. For these sites, the average difference in 85th percentile speed was -0.43 mph, the biggest negative difference being -1.6 mph, and the biggest positive difference being 1.5 mph. A Bootstrapping analysis was then performed to predict the expected distribution of speed differences in 85th percentile speeds. This analysis also showed the 85th percentile speeds by the LiDAR gun and the Advance sensor were not significantly different for practical traffic engineering applications.",,"NTL, TRIS, ATRI, USDOT, STATEDOT",UT-16.05,,,,,,,,,,14-8290,,,,,,,,,,"Accuracy, Data collection, Evaluation, Field studies, Free flow speeds, Laser radar, Microwave detectors, Performance measurement, Sensors, Signalized intersections, Traffic volume, Utah","Data and Information Technology, Highways, Operations and Traffic Management",8/4/2016 1:04:00 PM,8/29/2016 11:10:00 AM,Digital/other,167p,,"Saito, Mitsuru","Sanchez, Greg H","Schultz, Grant G",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Appendices, Figures, Photos, References, Tables",2016-05-00,,,,,,,,,,,,,Brigham Young University,Utah Department of Transportation,Federal Highway Administration,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Utah Department of Transportation,,,,,,,,,,,,,Final Report,10/2013-5/2016,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

Given that appropriate deployment decisions are essential to a program’s effectiveness, a number of deployment priorities are generally included in most ASE guidelines. However, when implementing the guidelines, most descriptions of deployment goals are so qualitative that they might have multiple quantitative interpretations, and thus affecting the identification of specific deployment considerations. In addition, limited research has been done to improve the process by which guidelines are implemented. Therefore, this paper proposes quantitative measures for an ASE program, in order to facilitate interpretation of the main ASE principles and improve deployment decisions. To illustrate the various types of high-priority deployment considerations, a case study in the city of Edmonton in the province of Alberta, Canada is presented. It explores the deployment outcomes of the mobile photo enforcement (MPE) program in Edmonton, in relation to six priorities identified in the provincial enforcement guidelines. Two performance measures, spatial coverage and enforcement intensity, are assessed for priority sites and non-priority sites. Moreover, the distance halo effects of MPE are considered in the review of spatial coverage. All findings are visualized using Geographic Information Systems, such that high priority sites and coverage of these sites in the historical deployment can be visually assessed.

The survey was part of a larger study that accompanied the introduction of digital speed cameras. Speed camera deployment started in 2011, and till the end of 2013 twenty-one cameras were deployed in interurban road sections. Yearly surveys were taken between 2010 and 2013 in 9 gas stations near speed camera installation sites in order to capture drivers’ opinions about speed and enforcement. Overall, 1993 drivers were interviewed.  In terms of admitted speed behavior, 38% of the drivers in 2010, 21% in 2011, 13% in 2012 and 11% in 2013 reported that their driving speed was above the perceived posted speed limit. The proportion of drivers indicating some speed camera influence on driving decreased over the years. In addition, the majority of drivers (61%) predicted positive impact of speed cameras on safety. This result did not change significantly over the years. The main stated explanation for speed limit violations was time pressure, while the main stated explanation for respecting the posted speed was enforcement, rather than safety concerns.  Linear regression and sigmoidal models were applied to describe the linkage between the reported driving speed (dependent) and the perceived posted speed (independent). The sigmoidal model fitted the data better, especially at high levels of the perceived posted speeds. That is, although the perceived posted speed increased, at some point the actual driving speed levels off (asymptote) and did not increase. Moreover, the authors found that the upper asymptote of the sigmoidal model decreased over the years: from 113.22 (SE = 18.84) km/h in 2010 to 88.92 (SE = 1.55) km/h in 2013.

Speed and distraction are among the top contributing factors to work zone crashes (Garber & Zhao, 2002; Mountain, Hirst, & Maher, 2005; Wilson, Willis, Hendrikz, Le Brocque, & Bellamy, 2006). The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of different types of speed enforcement methods on driver attention in work zones. The investigation not only examined enforcement methods currently used in Minnesota, but also examined how implementing automated speed enforcement (ASE), which is not currently used in Minnesota, may influence driver attention and behavior in simulated work zones. Overall, the results do not appear to support the hypothesis that ASE without dynamic speed display sign (DSDS) improves driver attention in work zones. There is some evidence, however, that drivers did heighten their visual attention in work zones with ASE+DSDS enforcement.

In addition, a survey of 23 National Road Authorities (NRAs) from 20 countries was completed to understand CMF use and CMF needs within NRAs. The survey identified a number of CMFs that are useful to NRAs but not readily available. Based on both the literature review and the NRA survey, the PRACT project developed some key CMFs that are currently missing or underrepresented in the literature. CMFs were developed for motorways and 2-way rural roads using data from Italy, England and Germany. A number of CMFs were developed, including for work zones, speed enforcement, high friction wearing course, traffic composition, horizontal curvature and vertical gradient.

ATM systems apply proactive strategies to improve safety and mobility, as well as to reduce emissions, noise, and fuel consumption. As one of the key elements in the ATM toolbox, variable speed limit (VSL) systems are being increasingly deployed around the United States. In the past, most VSL systems in Europe have included automated enforcement as part of the system, while systems in the United States have relied on traditional speed enforcement strategies. In the Portland, Oregon, metropolitan area, a new traffic- and weather-responsive VSL system has been deployed. It uses variable advisory speeds (VAS), allowing law enforcement to rely on the basic rule for enforcement. Thanks to the availability of high-resolution intelligent transportation systems data, it is possible to conduct post hoc analysis after VSL deployments. This paper focuses on driver compliance with displayed VAS messages. ""Compliance""  is defined as the difference between the displayed speed and the measured speed of traffic. In addition to analyzing more than 35 days at the Portland site, for comparison purposes, some additional analysis of a VSL site in Munich, Germany, is also included. The analysis of compliance for VSL–VAS deployments is useful for understanding the benefits of these important ATM strategies, assisting with targeting enforcement actions, and better understanding where and when to employ VSL–VAS systems.",,"TRIS, TRB, ATRI",16-3032,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Compliance, Methodology, Munich (Germany), Portland (Oregon), Traffic law enforcement, Variable speed limits","Highways, Operations and Traffic Management, Safety and Human Factors",1/12/2016 5:21:00 PM,12/5/2016 12:00:00 PM,Print,pp 77–88,,"Riggins, Gary","Bertini, Robert L","Ackaah, Williams","Bogenberger, Klaus",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Figures, References, Tables",2016-00-00,Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Find a library where document is available,,,,,,,,,,9780309441247,,2554,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

1393339,01590338,Evaluating the Effect of Enforcement on Speed Distributions Using Probe Vehicle Data,,DO,English,,,,,,,Transportation Research Board Annual Meeting 2016 Paper #16-3625,"Collecting driving speed data is a crucial element in road safety research. Recent technological developments enable a wide range of alternative traffic monitoring possibilities. In particular, the availability of cellular and GPS devices creates the opportunity to utilize probe vehicle data. To date, most studies using probe vehicle data focused on operational purposes such as congestion identification, relying primarily on average speeds. Probe vehicle data can also be useful for safety studies. The data is often collected continuously (24/7, 365 days a year). It can therefore enable detailed analyses of the continuous changes in speed over time. In addition, the spatial coverage of the data enables continuous evaluation of the halo effect of speed enforcement installation, compared with a relatively small number of measurement sites (e.g. 3-5) in traditional methods. Probe vehicle data offer one more advantage: when performing a before-after study, the before measurements have to be performed before camera installation but installation plans may change. Probe vehicle data, especially if collected continuously, regardless of research needs, enable researchers to choose the desired sites and times for analysis in retrospect, after the cameras have been installed. The purpose of this paper is to describe the results obtained from analysis of probe vehicle data on the effect of speed enforcement cameras that were installed at non-urban roads in Israel during 2011-2013. In addition to the contribution regarding the impact of enforcement cameras, the paper demonstrates the potential (as well as the challenges) of using probe vehicle data for safety studies.","This paper was sponsored by TRB committee ANB40 Standing Committee on Traffic Law Enforcement.

Application of Hierarchical Models to Crash Data,,DO,English,,,https://doi.org/10.3141/2555-01,,,,,"Highway infrastructure requires periodic maintenance, reconstruction, and rehabilitation. As a result, highway users have to deal with work zone activities such as lane closures and lane shifts or crossovers, and they must be aware of changes in road conditions to drive safely through work zones. A large-scale statewide crash database from the Virginia Department of Transportation was used in this study to examine correlations between precrash actions and the severity of the injuries of drivers involved in crashes. An innovative aspect of this study is that it accounts for the injury severity of each vehicle driver involved in a crash by estimating hierarchical models. The correlates of the severity of a driver’s injury are nested in crashes. Modeling revealed that for work zone crashes the chances of driver injury are 9.9% to 10.3% higher than for the base behavior (i.e., no improper actions by the driver) if the driver intentionally commits an improper action or a violation. For non–work zone crashes, the chances of injury are higher by only 1.7% to 5.7% compared with the base behavior. Such actions and violations are mainly the following: (a) speeding, (b) following too closely, and (c) disregarding officers, flaggers, signals, and signs. The correlations between precrash actions and injury severity provide insights into safety improvements (e.g., effective speed enforcement and traffic regulations) that could reduce the risk of injury in work zones. Hierarchies embedded in highway crash data were explored in this study to make methodological and empirical contributions to the understanding of work zone safety and to improve understanding of behaviors that lead to injuries and fatalities in work zone crashes.",,"TRIS, TRB, ATRI",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Crash data, Drivers, Human factors in crashes, Injury severity, Traffic violations, Virginia, Work zone safety","Highways, Operations and Traffic Management, Safety and Human Factors",3/30/2016 2:20:00 PM,10/26/2016 1:38:00 PM,Print,pp 1-11,,"Liu, Jun","Khattak, Asad","Zhang, Meng",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Figures, References, Tables",2016-00-00,Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Find a library where document is available,,,,,,,,,,9780309441193,,2555,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

This is why subsequent road safety programmes (implemented over the 20 years) were designed to improve pedestrian safety, reduce speeding and treat sources of roadside hazards. The article gives a short diagnosis of Poland's road safety, evaluates its subsequent road safety programmes called GAMBIT 1996, GAMBIT 2000 and GAMBIT 2005 with its far-reaching Vision Zero just as in a number of countries. The main road safety problems that Poland must solve are identified. A risk-based road safety management method is outlined.

Thus, the effect of them on speeding behavior is unclear. This lack of knowledge on the effect of the cameras may lead to irrational decision making in terms of investment in and configuration of enforcement facilities. In this study, sample speed data were collected at five locations near a speed camera on the G45 Freeway (i.e., the Daguang Freeway) in China. Statistics showed that the distance effect model of the speed camera can be represented by a concave parabolic function. Speeding drivers begin to slow down to speed limits when they approach advance warning signs, and then they immediately speed up after passing the enforcement site. The deterrent effect of fixed-site speed enforcement is limited to a 300-meter range. Deterrence theory was used to conclude that there is an obvious distance halo effect for fixed-site speed enforcement locations. The findings of this study imply that the deterrent effect of fixed-site speed enforcement is weak due to its short effective distance and overt form of control. Ultimately, reasonable configuration of enforcement facilities and use of fixed-site facilities in combination with mobile speed enforcement are appropriate methods that can be used to reduce speeding.",© 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.,"TRIS, ASCE",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Automated enforcement, China, Deterrents, Highway safety, Speeding, Traffic law enforcement, Video cameras","Highways, Operations and Traffic Management, Safety and Human Factors",6/29/2016 3:06:00 PM,8/1/2016 9:14:00 AM,Web,pp 1609-1614,,"Yang, Mengdie","Ma, Jun","Chen, Qiang","Yang, Yichi",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,References,2016-00-00,,16th COTA International Conference of Transportation Professionals,Transportation Research Board,Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE),American Society of Civil Engineers,,,,,,,,American Society of Civil Engineers,,,,,,,,,,"Wang, Xiaokun","Zhang, Yu","Ge, Ying-En","Huang, Youfang",,,,,,,Find a library where document is available,,,,,,,,,,9780784479896,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

The average speed of vehicles is calculated from the section length and the transit time. The monitoring is based on the identification of number plates at the entrance and exit of the section via cameras and software. On the basis of the time stamps at the entrance and exit points, and the distance between these points, the average speed of vehicles is calculated and infringements identified. In Austria, average speed enforcement has been in use since 2003. Besides fixed appliances there are also mobile in use in temporary work zones. This study of the Austrian Road Safety Board reviewed the effectiveness of average speed enforcement and developed recommendations for use.

The Federal Highway Administration’s Highway Driving Simulator (HDS) was used to collect drivers’ responses as a function of facility speed limit and whether the driver was in a hurry. From these responses, a DZ model was developed via agent-based modeling and simulation (ABMS) under the extended belief-desire-intention (E-BDI) framework. This framework represents uncertain perception and decision behaviors of humans in a probabilistic manner. To demonstrate and validate the proposed approach, the drivers’ actions under two circumstances were compared: (1) drivers only knew the approach speed and distance to the stop (i.e., internal information); and (2) drivers knew the internal information as well as external information, such as presence of a pedestrian countdown signal or presence of a red-light photo enforcement camera, and the behavior of an adjacent vehicle. The experiments indicate that sufficient external information could accurately predict the decisions of drivers and thus reduce the number of red-light violations that could potentially cause accidents at an intersection.

The commuter/passenger railroads that operate on the NEC are deploying ACSES. The Class I freight railroads are deploying ITC nationwide, including on the NEC. Each of these PTC systems uses a 220 MHz data radio from different manufacturers, with different communication protocols. The use of dissimilar radio types that operate asynchronously within the same frequency band introduces the potential for communication problems for ACSES and ITC deployments within the NEC. In particular, concurrent use of the ACSES and ITC radios within close proximity will cause loss of messages for the other type of radio due to receiver desense. Throughout the NEC, ACSES and ITC will be deployed in close proximity, sometimes on the same track bed. In some locations, freight trains will be equipped with both ACSES and ITC locomotive on board equipment and will transition between ACSES and ITC territory in order to allow freight and passenger trains to operate on the same track. During the transitions between ITC and ACSES controlled territories, both of the aforementioned 220 MHz radios will be in operation.

The manner in which specific deterrence can influence recidivist behaviour can be conceptualised in different ways. While any reduction in speeding will have road safety benefits, the ways in which a ‘reduction’ is determined deserves greater methodological attention and has implications for countermeasure evaluation more generally. The primary aim of this research was to assess the specific deterrent impact of penalty increases for speeding offences in Queensland, Australia, in 2003 on two cohorts of drivers detected for speeding prior to and after the penalty changes were investigated. Since the literature is relatively silent on how to assess recidivism in the speeding context, the secondary research aim was to contribute to the literature regarding ways to conceptualise and measure specific deterrence in the speeding context. The authors propose a novel way of operationalising four measures which reflect different ways in which a specific deterrence effect could be conceptualised: (1) the proportion of offenders who re-offended in the follow up period; (2) the overall frequency of re-offending in the follow up period; (3) the length of delay to re-offence among those who re-offended; and (4) the average number of re-offences during the follow up period among those who re-offended. Consistent with expectations, results suggested an absolute deterrent effect of penalty changes, as evidenced by significant reductions in the proportion of drivers who re-offended and the overall frequency of re-offending, although effect sizes were small. Contrary to expectations, however, there was no evidence of a marginal specific deterrent effect among those who re-offended, with a significant reduction in the length of time to re-offence and no significant change in the average number of offences committed. Additional exploratory analyses investigating potential influences of the severity of the index offence, offence history, and method of detection revealed mixed results. Access to additional data from various sources suggested that the main findings were not influenced by changes in speed enforcement activity, public awareness of penalty changes, or driving exposure during the study period. Study limitations and recommendations for future research are discussed with a view to promoting more extensive evaluations of penalty changes and better understanding of how such changes may impact on motorists’ perceptions of enforcement and sanctions, as well as on recidivist behaviour.",Abstract reprinted with permission of Elsevier.,TRIS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Highway safety, Moving violations, Queensland, Recidivism, Speeding, Traffic law enforcement","Highways, Operations and Traffic Management, Safety and Human Factors, I73: Traffic Control",10/6/2015 9:21:00 AM,10/28/2015 10:19:00 AM,Web,pp 27-37,,"Watson, B","Siskind, V","Fleiter, J J","Watson, A","Soole, D",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Figures, References, Tables",2015-11-00,Accident Analysis & Prevention,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Find a library where document is available,,,,,,,,,,,84,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

The paper is based on a game-theoretic model of how the rate of violations and the amount of enforcement is determined by the interaction between drivers and the police. This model makes predictions both about how drivers will adapt to changes in the amount of enforcement (the more enforcement, the less violations) as well as how the police will adapt to changes in the rate of violations (the less violations, the less enforcement). The paper attempts to test the game-theoretic model empirically. Testing the model rigorously is difficult, mainly because some of the relevant variables are not reliably measured and are endogenous. Two models were developed: one to identify sources of changes in the rate of violations, one to identify sources of changes in the amount of enforcement.

However, because drivers are alerted about enforcement via on-board navigation systems and roadside signs, they can avoid enforcement by momentarily reducing their speeds near ASES locations. This enforcement avoidance behavior (EAB) can induce sudden changes in speed near the enforcement locations and thereby increase risk of crash occurrence.  In light of this situation, the present study evaluates the effects of ASES on traffic behavior and safety. An analysis of traffic data shows that drivers indeed diminish their speeds near enforcement locations, and accelerate shortly after passing the locations. To investigate how this behavior affects safety performance, this study, by using Empirical Bayes analysis with comparison groups, compares crash occurrences along a certain section before and after the installation of ASES. The comparative analysis shows that overall crash occurrence dropped by 7.6% on average near the enforcement locations, although the reduction was not significant. However, an average 11% non-significant increase in crash occurrence is also observed in the upstream segment, where enforcement is announced to drivers and traffic starts to diminish speed.  The findings suggest that the sudden changes in traffic speed induced by EAB substantially negate the benefits of ASES. Therefore, modification of the design of current ASES is required to mitigate EAB and further improve the effectiveness of ASES.",Abstract reprinted with permission of Elsevier.,TRIS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Automated enforcement, Countermeasures, Expressways, Korea, Speed control, Speeding, Traffic crashes, Traffic law enforcement","Highways, Operations and Traffic Management, Safety and Human Factors",5/26/2015 9:51:00 AM,6/1/2015 1:41:00 PM,Web,pp 57-66,,"Shim, Jisup","Park, Shin Hyoung","Chung, Sungbong","Jang, Kitae",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,References,2015-07-00,Accident Analysis & Prevention,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Find a library where document is available,,,,,,,,,,,80,0,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

Speed cameras are one of the most common speed enforcement tools. Most of the speed cameras around the world are overt, but there is evidence that this can cause a “kangaroo effect” in driving patterns. One suggested alternative to prevent this kangaroo effect is the use of covert cameras. Another issue relevant to the effect of enforcement countermeasures on speeding is the timing of the fine. There is general agreement on the importance of the immediacy of the punishment, however, in the context of speed limit enforcement, implementing such immediate punishment is difficult. An immediate feedback that mediates the delay between the speed violation and getting a ticket is one possible solution. This study examines combinations of concealment and the timing of the fine in operating speed cameras in order to evaluate the most effective one in terms of enforcing speed limits. Using a driving simulator, the driving performance of the following four experimental groups was tested: (1) overt cameras with delayed feedback, (2) overt cameras with immediate feedback, (3) covert cameras with delayed feedback, and (4) covert cameras with immediate feedback. Each of the 58 participants drove in the same scenario on three different days. The results showed that both median speed and speed variance were higher with overt than with covert cameras. Moreover, implementing a covert camera system along with immediate feedback was more conducive to drivers maintaining steady speeds at the permitted levels from the very beginning. Finally, both ‘overt cameras’ groups exhibit a kangaroo effect throughout the entire experiment. It can be concluded that an implementation strategy consisting of covert speed cameras combined with immediate feedback to the offender is potentially an optimal way to motivate drivers to maintain speeds at the speed limit.",Abstract reprinted with permission of Elsevier.,TRIS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Automated enforcement, Cameras, Driver feedback, Driver performance, Offenders, Speeding, Traffic law enforcement","Highways, Operations and Traffic Management, Safety and Human Factors, I73: Traffic Control",5/4/2015 12:05:00 PM,5/18/2015 11:02:00 AM,Web,pp 231-240,,"Marciano, Hadas","Setter, Pe’erly","Norman, Joel",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,References,2015-06-00,Accident Analysis & Prevention,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Find a library where document is available,,,,,,,,,,,79,0,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

Its technology allows vehicles whose average speed exceeds the speed limit over the controlled section to be fined. It therefore encourages compliance over distances longer than those where spot enforcement policies have been in place.  In this paper, a procedure for consistently setting speed limits with such enforcement systems is proposed. Such a method has been applied to design the speed limits on two motorways in the district of Naples, Italy, where P2P enforcement systems became operational in 2009 and 2010. The speed limits, which were set using the Italian geometric design standard to assess vehicle stability and stopping sight distance, have been compared with those provided by using well-known international standards.  The impact of the newly designed speed limits and of the P2P enforcement system on drivers’ speeding behaviour has been quantified for each highway section and vehicle type. In fact, accurate measurements of the average travel speeds of each vehicle crossing the enforced sections, before and after the activation of the system, were available. The migration from the old speed limits with spot speed enforcement to the new approach resulted in a notable increase in drivers’ compliance to the speed limits with a remarkable decrease in both the average of individual speeds and in their standard deviation.  In addition, the analysis of 3 years of data shows that a gradual adaptation of drivers’ behaviour to the system took place. In particular, a decreasing compliance to the speed limits points to a non-optimal system management. Finally, the results of a revealed preference survey allowed the authors to make a behavioural interpretation regarding the significantly different impacts measured on the two motorways.",Abstract reprinted with permission of Elsevier.,TRIS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Average travel speed, Compliance, Design speed, Naples (Italy), Operating speed, Speed limits, Speeding, Traffic law enforcement","Design, Highways, Law, Operations and Traffic Management, I73: Traffic Control",3/30/2015 1:36:00 PM,4/7/2015 11:40:00 AM,Digital/other,pp 1-18,,"Montella, Alfonso","Punzo, Vincenzo","Chiaradonna, Salvatore","Mauriello, Filomena","Montanino, Marcello",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Figures, References, Tables",2015-04-00,Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Find a library where document is available,,,,,,,,,,,53,0,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

Drivers’ speeds on these roads were also sampled with a speed gun. The results showed large differences between speeds chosen for different driving purposes; the lowest speeds were chosen when the goal was economy and the highest when driving for fun. In addition, there were individual differences in speed preferences such that some drivers indicated that their usual speed was above what they believed was a safe speed while others indicated that they usually drove even slower than what they thought was safe. These differences may account for much of the speed heterogeneity observed in on-road behaviour. The results also showed that drivers’ speed choices are highly influenced by their usual speeds, even more so than their beliefs regarding what constitutes a safe speed, which may help explain non-compliance with speed limits.

Since 2005 the surveys have been expanded with samples of sites on the 50 km/h road network. The 2000 survey was used as the baseline year for the comparisons with all subsequent surveys from which road safety and speed performance indicators were derived as measures of driver speed behaviours over the time. The principal objective of the surveys was to measure changes in driver speed behaviours at general locations of the road network over time and to relate those changes to the effectiveness of various speed related road safety programs implemented in the state. Effectiveness of speed road safety programmes is estimated in terms of changes in: speed compliance rates, proportion of drivers exceeding 10 or more km/h above the speed limit, 85th percentile and mean speed.

The study reviewed the impacts of adopting a lower design speed on road design, safety, traffic operations and capacity, and on speed limit enforcement. The study investigated operating speeds on different parts of the Queensland state road network. It was found that the speed compliance was not yet sufficient to recommend adoption of the speed limit as the design speed on any part of the network. A review of point-to-point enforcement evaluations did not produce clear conclusions which could lead to the adoption of reduced design speed under this enforcement regime. An option of speed limit plus 5 km/h guidance for design speed was considered in detail. It was found that the consistency of speed limit compliance varied across the road network, whole-of-life cost benefits would be marginal, and there would be marginally negative safety and operational impacts. The report recommends retaining the current approach to design speed selection until speed enforcement reduces operating speeds more consistently across the road network.",,ATRI,R8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Compliance, Compliance, Highway design, Highway engineering, Law enforcement, Law enforcement, Queensland, Road design, Road engineering, Road network, Speed, Speed, Speed limit, Speed limits, Speeding, Speeding, Types of roads by network","Highways, Security and Emergencies",12/9/2021 9:53:00 AM,12/9/2021 9:53:00 AM,,55p,,"Jurewicz, C","Pratt, K","Makwasha, T","Beecroft, A",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2015-03-00,,,,,,,,,,,,,National Asset Centre of Excellence (NACOE),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

The P2P speed enforcement is a relatively new approach to traffic law enforcement that involves the calculation of the average speed over a section. To evaluate the speed effects, they performed a before–after analysis of speed data investigating also effects on non-compliance to speed limits. To evaluate the safety effects, they carried out an empirical Bayes observational before-and-after study.  The P2P system led to very positive effects on both speed and safety. As far as the effects on the section average travel speeds, the system yielded to a reduction in the mean speed, the 85th percentile speed, the standard deviation of speed, and the proportion of drivers exceeding the speed limits, exceeding the speed limits more than 10 km/h, and exceeding the speed limits more than 20 km/h. The best results were the decrease of the speed variability and the reduction of the excessive speeding behavior. The decrease in the standard deviation of speed was 26% while the proportion of light and heavy vehicles exceeding the speed limits more than 20 km/h was reduced respectively by 84 and 77%.  As far as the safety effects, the P2P system yielded to a 32% reduction in the total crashes, with a lower 95% confidence limit of the estimate equal to 22%. The greatest crash reductions were in rainy weather (57%), on wet pavement (51%), on curves (49%), for single vehicle crashes (44%), and for injury crashes (37%). It is noteworthy that the system produced a statistically significant reduction of 21% in total crashes also in the part of the motorway where it was not activated, thus generating a significant spillover effect.  The investigation of the effects of the P2P system on speed and safety over time allowed to develop crash modification functions where the relationship between crash modification factors and speed parameters (mean speed, 85th percentile speed, and standard deviation of speed) was expressed by a power function. Crash modification functions show that the effect of speed on safety is greater on curves and for injury crashes.  Even though the study results show excellent outcomes, the authors must point out that the crash reduction effects decreased over time and speed, speed variability, and non-compliance to speed limits significantly increased over time. To maintain its effectiveness over time, P2P speed enforcement must be actively managed, i.e. constantly monitored and supported by appropriate sanctions.",Abstract reprinted with permission of Elsevier.,TRIS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Highway safety, Italy, Speed limits, Traffic crashes, Traffic law enforcement, Urban highways","Highways, Safety and Human Factors, I83: Accidents and the Human Factor",1/29/2015 12:14:00 PM,2/26/2015 10:02:00 AM,Digital/other,pp 164-178,,"Montella, Alfonso","Imbriani, Lella Liana","Marzano, Vittorio","Mauriello, Filomena",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Figures, References, Tables",2015-02-00,Accident Analysis & Prevention,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Find a library where document is available,,,,,,,,,,,75,0,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

This paper examined the safety impacts of Red Light Cameras (RLCs) on traffic crashes at signalized intersections using the Empirical Bayes (EB) method. Data were obtained from the Florida Department of Transportation for twenty-five RLC equipped intersections in Orange County, Florida. Additional fifty intersections that remained with no photo enforcement in the vicinity of the treated sites were collected to examine the spillover effects on the same corridors. The safety evaluation was performed at three main levels; only target approaches where RLCs were installed, all approaches on RLC intersections, and non-RLC intersections located on the same travel corridors as the camera equipped intersections. Moreover, the spatial spillover effects of RLCs were also examined on an aggregate level to evaluate the safety impacts on driver behavior at a regional scale. The results from this study indicated that there was a consistent significant reduction in angle and left-turn crashes and a significant increase in rear-end crashes on target approaches, in addition, the magnitude and the direction of these effects, to a lesser degree, were found similar on the whole intersection. Similar trends in shift of crash types were spilled-over to non-RLC intersections in the proximity of the treated sites.

As a part of these efforts, this research aims to develop crash modification factors (CMFs) of two alignment elements, as well as eight safety countermeasures for Korean freeways. To do this, classical safety performance functions (SPFs) for each freeway were developed. To develop the CMFs of two alignment elements, horizontal curve and vertical grade, the authors also estimated inclusive SPFs that include the alignment elements together with traffic volume and segment length as independent variables. The CMFs of horizontal curve and vertical grade were calculated as the marginal effect of their coefficients on the inclusive SPFs. Then, eight CMFs for safety countermeasures including delineator posts, automated speed enforcement cameras, rumble strips, chevron signs, roadside barriers, grooving, illumination and median barriers were developed. The regression-to-the-mean (RTM) bias, time trend of crash count, and effect of traffic volume change were corrected by using the empirical Bayes (EB) method. The developed CMFs in this study were compared with those from previous literature and discussed the findings from the comparison.

Speed enforcement is one of the most common countermeasures used to reduce speed. However, a gap exists in the literature regarding the effectiveness of automated mobile photo enforcement on urban arterial roads. This study addresses this gap using the before-and-after empirical Bayes method to account for regression to the mean effects and other confounding factors. Locally developed safety performance functions and yearly calibration factors for different collision severities were obtained by using a reference group of urban arterial roads. The evaluation period covers 8 years. Collision records, deployment information, traffic counts, and road geometric data were collected. The results showed consistent reductions in different collision severities; the reductions ranged from 14% to 20%, with the highest reductions observed for severe collisions. The enforced segments were further categorized according to site selection criteria and deployment hours to examine the effect of enforcement on collision reduction. More reductions were found at segments that had more collisions during the before period and longer deployment hours. The study also compared the safety effects of continuous and discontinuous enforcement strategies on different arterials, and the analysis revealed that continuous enforcement achieved more reductions across all severities and types of collisions. The study also investigated the spillover effects on adjacent unenforced approaches.

1337520,01557805,Impacts of Red Light Photo Enforcement Cameras on Clearance Lost Time at Signalized Intersections,,DO,English,,,,,,,Transportation Research Board Annual Meeting 2015 Paper #15-2245,"Red light running (RLR) is one of the most common violations drivers commit at signalized intersections. To avoid RLR violations, some drivers may decide to stop abruptly, even though they had the opportunity to cross the stop line before the onset of the red light. This action happens more frequently at the intersections with a red light camera (RLC). The consequence of this change in drivers’ stopping behavior is the potential reduction of the usable clearance interval and the slight decline in the intersection capacity. However, the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) and the Alabama Department of Transportation (ALDOT) Traffic Signal Design Guide and Timing Manual take different approaches to estimate the clearance lost time (CLT) for capacity analysis of signalized intersections; there is not an adjustment factor for considering the impact of RLCs. In an attempt to quantify the effect of RLCs on the capacity of signalized intersections, field data were collected at eight intersections: four with RLCs and four without, in the cities of Opelika, and Auburn, Alabama. A total of 1,191 cycles and a total of 1,863 drivers’ responses to clearance intervals were used to estimate the CLT. It was found that the estimated CLT at the approach with a RLC is approximately 2.7 seconds longer than the default value presented by HCM and about 1.1 seconds longer than one estimated by ALDOT method. On average, the unused yellow time was a half second longer in RLC intersections than the intersections without RLCs.",This paper was sponsored by TRB committee AHB40 Highway Capacity and Quality of Service.,"TRIS, TRB, ATRI",15-2245,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Auburn (Alabama), Automated enforcement, Cameras, Clearance interval (Traffic signal cycle), Highway capacity, Opelika (Alabama), Red light running, Signalized intersections","Highways, Law, Operations and Traffic Management, I73: Traffic Control",12/30/2014 12:48:00 PM,3/25/2015 4:20:00 PM,Digital/other,14p,,"Baratian-Ghorghi, Fatemeh","Zhou, Huaguo","Wasilefsky, Isaac",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Figures, Maps, References, Tables",2015-00-00,,Transportation Research Board 94th Annual Meeting,Transportation Research Board,,,,,,,,,,Transportation Research Board,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Transportation Research Board Business Office,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

1337552,01557552,Fixed And Random Effect Models To Predict Operating Speed Percentiles On Rural Two-lane Highways,,DO,English,,,,,,,Transportation Research Board Annual Meeting 2015 Paper #15-2307,"This paper presents the results obtained from the estimation of free-flow speed on two-lane rural highways. The data used for the analysis were collected in the Northwest of Italy using video cameras and a laser speed gun. The model structure adopted separates the estimate of the central tendency of speeds from the typical deviations of individual speeds. Hence, in the model the same set of variables can be used to determine the mean value and the standard deviation of the speed distribution; the desired speed percentile is then calculated by considering the associated standard normal random variable (Z). Random effects (RE) were included in the model to account for the variability in time and space of the data that contains repeated measurements for the same road/section/direction and to remove the dependency between any estimation errors from individual observations. Fixed effect (FE) models are also calibrated for comparison purposes and the BIC criterion is used for variable selection and applied to both the FE and RE models. Estimates reveal many geometric variables in the FE model to be significant, while the RE model only selects the section curvature and the pedestrian density for the estimation of the mean, and nearly all the geometric variables in the estimation of the standard deviation. The random effects relative to the road are not significant, which means that, once the effects related to the random selection of cross sections and direction have been observed, the speed measurements are relatively stable.",This paper was sponsored by TRB committee AHB65 Operational Effects of Geometrics.,"TRIS, TRB, ATRI",15-2307,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Data analysis, Free flow speeds, Geometric design, Italy, Linear regression analysis, Operating speed, Rural highways, Traffic speed measurement, Two lane highways","Data and Information Technology, Design, Highways, Operations and Traffic Management, Planning and Forecasting, I72: Traffic and Transport Planning",12/30/2014 12:49:00 PM,3/23/2015 8:59:00 AM,Digital/other,16p,,"Bassani, Marco","Cirillo, Cinzia","Molinari, Serena","Tremblay, Jean-Michel",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Figures, References, Tables",2015-00-00,,Transportation Research Board 94th Annual Meeting,Transportation Research Board,,,,,,,,,,Transportation Research Board,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Transportation Research Board Business Office,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

The DSL system installed, in addition to the high density of surveillance equipment available, makes this stretch a suitable highway lab. The objective of the experiment was to construct a comprehensive database of traffic engineering variables on a freeway site when different speed limits apply. Detailed measurements of vehicle counts, speeds, occupancies, lane changing maneuvers and travel times were taken. The potential of this multi-source database is huge. For instance, preliminary analysis empirically proves that drivers’ compliance with dynamic speed limits is very limited, unless speed enforcement devices are present. In addition, in controlled sections with high compliance rates, it is observed that lowering the speed limit extends the range for critical occupancies beyond the typical values without changing the freeway capacity. This might be due to the observed reduction in the lane changing activity at these occupancy levels and for low speed limits. A direct consequence of this fact is that, even with a high compliance to very low speed limits (e.g. 40 km/h), the flow restriction imposed is insignificant. Stable flows near capacity are maintained together with very low speeds and very high densities. In practice, this means that the mainline metering capabilities of DSL are limited.",This paper was sponsored by TRB committee AHB20 Freeway Operations.,"TRIS, TRB, ATRI",15-2729,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Barcelona (Spain), Data analysis, Freeway management systems, Freeway operations, Lane changing, Speed control, Traffic data, Variable speed limits","Data and Information Technology, Highways, Operations and Traffic Management, I73: Traffic Control",12/30/2014 12:56:00 PM,3/17/2015 9:02:00 AM,Digital/other,20p,,"Soriguera, Francesc","Martínez-Josemaría, Irene","Menéndez, Mónica",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Figures, References, Tables",2015-00-00,,Transportation Research Board 94th Annual Meeting,Transportation Research Board,,,,,,,,,,Transportation Research Board,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Transportation Research Board Business Office,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

1354117,01563009,Quantifying the contribution of low-level speeding to trauma in Victoria,,DO,English,,,http://acrs.org.au/publications/conference-papers/database/,,,ARRB,,"Low-level speeding (driving at up to 10 km/h above the limit) is deemed to be the major contributor to speeding-related casualty crashes in Victoria. Understanding the size of the trauma problem that could be attributed to low level speeding is important for honing speed enforcement and public education strategies. In this study, we attempted to estimate the proportion of casualty crashes occurring on Victorian roads that could be attributed to low-level speeding. Almost 350,000 vehicle traveling speed recordings collected by covert mobile speed cameras across Melbourne Metro and regional Victoria, and within 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100 and 110 km/h zones were compiled. The casualty crash risk formulae developed by Kloeden et al. (1997; 2001; 2002) were used to estimate the casualty risks associated with various levels of speeding. These risk levels were then combined with the survey speed data to estimate the size of the casualty problem due to low-level speeding. Vehicle traveling speeds showed that 9.5% of Victorian drivers violated the speed limit. Among these speeders, 94.9% were low-level speeders. Our analyses showed that 79% of speeding-related casualty crashes in Victoria could be ascribed to low-level speeding, while excessive speeding (21+ km/h above the limit) is likely to contribute to only 4.3% of speeding-related casualty crashes in Victoria. The results of this study justify the emphasis placed on low level speeding by the enforcement regime and public education campaigns.

1354131,01563023,The good news about speed compliance in Victoria,,DO,English,,,http://acrs.org.au/publications/conference-papers/database/,,,ARRB,,"Low-level speeding has been a focus of the Transport Accident Commission&rsquo;s (TAC) public education program since 2001, yet achieving full compliance with speed limits remains a challenge. Public perceptions of speeding behaviour have changed for the better over the ensuing years, and speed surveys and enforcement data demonstrate that behaviour has changed. In preparation for the creation of a new wave of public education material, the authors reviewed an extensive range of survey data and vehicle speed data collected from covert mobile cameras. The overwhelming majority of Victorians comply with speed limits and a clear majority support the speed enforcement regime and view low level speeding (i.e. 5 km/h over the speed limit) as socially unacceptable. Indeed, the majority of Victorians think people should get booked for exceeding the speed limit in a 60 zone by 4 km/h. Compared with non-Victorians, Victorians are less tolerant of speeding and more likely to report driving at lower speeds. Social norms are shifting in favour of complying with speed limits. Road safety practitioners and decision makers may be surprised at the level of support for speed enforcement, speed limit settings and public education. The community should be seen as an ally in efforts to reduce road trauma through speed management. Public education should therefore seek to build upon the existing momentum to further reduce tolerance of low level speeding. The development of future speed enforcement strategies can also be informed by this data.",,"ITRD, ATRI",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Attitude (psychol), Australia, Driver improvement, Driver improvement programs, Drivers, Education, Enforcement (law), Law enforcement, Law enforcement, Public opinion, Public opinion, Publicity, Safe systems (road users), Speeding, Speeding, Victoria","Security and Emergencies, I83: Accidents and the Human Factor",5/15/2015 12:19:00 PM,5/15/2015 12:19:00 PM,,12p,,"Nieuwesteeg, M","Alavi, H",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2014-11-00,,"Australasian Road Safety Research Policing Education Conference, 2014, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

1354132,01563024,The impacts of a reduced speed enforcement tolerance threshold on road safety outcomes,,DO,English,,,http://acrs.org.au/publications/conference-papers/database/,,,ARRB,,"Internationally, speeding behaviour remains a crucial concern for road safety agencies and researchers. In 2013, 1,193 people in Australia and 254 in New Zealand died as a result of crashes. Speed is estimated to have been a factor in over a third of these deaths. New Zealand sought to reduce these preventable deaths by introducing a speed enforcement campaign that focussed on lowering the speed enforcement threshold from 10km/h to 4km/h over a 2-month period. The campaign was implemented to reduce the incidence of speeding behaviour in an effort to reduce the number and the severity of crashes during the historically high-risk summer holiday period. Speed survey data collected by semi-overt mobile speed cameras was used to analyse the effects of the intervention on speeding. A quasi-experimental study design incorporating generalised linear models was used to evaluate the effects of the intervention on speeding and crashes. The results showed significant reductions in speeding by 10km/h or less (36%), and for speeding in excess of 10km/h (45%). Analysis of crash data revealed possible decreases of fatal (22%), serious (8%), and minor crashes (16%), but these reductions were not statistically significant. Although the campaign had a significant and substantial effect on reducing speeding behaviour, the duration of intervention period was likely not sufficient to reflect the full effects of this reduction on road trauma. While this initiative shows considerable promise as a road safety intervention, research over an extended period is recommended to more fully test the effects on reducing crash risk.",,"ITRD, ATRI",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Accident prevention, Behavior, Crash countermeasure, Driver behaviour, Drivers, Enforcement (law), Injuries, Injury rate, Injury rates, Law enforcement, Law enforcement, New Zealand, Safe systems (road users), Speed limit, Speed limits, Speeding, Speeding, Traffic safety","Safety and Human Factors, Security and Emergencies, I83: Accidents and the Human Factor",5/15/2015 12:19:00 PM,5/15/2015 12:19:00 PM,,11p,,"van Lamoen, N K",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2014-11-00,,"Australasian Road Safety Research Policing Education Conference, 2014, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

1401762,01597273,"Law enforcement, road safety campaigns and their contribution to compliance: ""It's all about learning""",,DO,English,,,,,,Bundesanstalt für Straßenwesen (BASt),E221489,"Law enforcement and road safety campaigns are generic terms for two separate road safety initiatives, which may comprise several more specific measures. Sometimes these measures are used together and so intertwined that you can hardly tell the difference and say whether it is ""publicized enforcement"" or a ""road safety campaign accompanied by enforcement"". They need to be treated separately when the aim is to understand inherent mechanisms and evaluate their effects on behaviour and accidents. A separation is paramount when one wants to uncover the laws of learning that may be at work in the two cases. Unfortunately, enforcement is seldom specified when it is applied as part of a road safety campaign, which may mask its role as a contributing factor in campaign. Hence, separate analysis is required to uncover the effects of different law enforcement measures as with stationary and manual speed enforcement, patrolling, speed cameras, DUI enforcement, etc. As the focus on driver behaviour changes, it implies that we are talking about learning and learning laws, but such mechanisms are seldom used or discussed other than by very general concepts as ""experience"" or simply ""learning"". The main objective here is to go deeper into the two main measures - enforcement and campaigns - scrutinize and uncover inherent aspects about learning laws and mechanisms that have been at work when these measures have had effects on behaviour and accidents. As learning involves and is based on neurological processes, some findings from neuroscience are stated.

The campaign focussed on reducing speeding and involved the introduction of a reduced speed enforcement threshold and increased traffic enforcement intensity over a two-month summer period. The campaign, publicised as &ldquo;Safer Summer&rdquo;, was announced by a media launch event, and was accompanied by speed-related advertisements and extensive coverage in printed, online, and social media. The aims of the initiative were to decrease the prevalence of low-level speed violations and higher-end speeding in order to reduce the risk of crashes, injury and death. The campaign was implemented from 1 December 2013 until 31 January 2014. The purpose of this report is to evaluate the effects of the initiatives in terms of reductions in speeding and the risk of crashes and injury. Overall, the combined efforts of a reduced speed enforcement threshold, enforcement intensity, and public awareness effectively reduced driving speeds and speed violations over the high-risk holiday period.

To capture potential spillover effects of cameras, control groups at various distances from the intersections with cameras are considered. A Poisson panel data model with random coefficients is applied to these data and estimated using Bayesian methods. The program suffered from weaknesses in enforcement. The city’s courts did not uphold citations and this dampened the effect cameras had on drivers. These problems are accounted for in modeling. Controlling for these concerns, results indicate that the cameras decreased red light running related collisions, but increased right-angle and injury collisions, as well as collisions overall.",Abstract reprinted with permission of Elsevier.,TRIS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Automated enforcement, Cameras, Los Angeles (California), Red light running, Traffic crashes, Traffic safety","Highways, Operations and Traffic Management, Safety and Human Factors, I85: Safety Devices used in Transport Infrastructure",11/6/2014 11:05:00 AM,11/24/2014 3:49:00 PM,Web,pp 165-182,,"Wong, Timothy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,References,2014-11-00,Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Find a library where document is available,,,,,,,,,,,69,0,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

Statistics show that approximately 45 percent of crashes at intersections caused by red light running result in severe injuries and fatalities, while only approximately 30 percent of all other types of intersection crashes cause injuries or fatalities. Over the past decade, many US cities and counties have deployed red light running photo enforcement systems for signalized intersections within their jurisdictions to potentially reduce red light running related crashes. This study proposes an empirical Bayesian (EB) before-after analysis method that computes a weighed sum of crashes observed in the field and crashes predicted by safety performance functions (SPFs) to mitigate regression-to-mean biases for analyzing crash reduction effects of red light running enforcement. The analysis explicitly considers red light running related crash types, including head-on, rear-end, angle, turning, sideswipe in the same direction, and sideswipe in the opposite direction; and crash severity levels classified as fatal, injury, and property damage only (PDO). A computational study is conducted to examine the effectiveness of the Chicago program with red light running photo enforcement systems deployed for nearly two hundred signalized intersections. It is revealed that the use of red light running photo enforcement on the whole is positive, as demonstrated by reductions in all types of fatal crashes by 4–48 percent, and injury-related angle crashes by 1 percent. However, it slightly raises PDO-related angle crashes and moderately increases injury and PDO related rear-end crashes.

In most cases this means lower speeds, both urban and rural. This research considers the level of acceptance of reduced speed limits and forms part of a NZTA research project on the compliance and acceptance of safer speeds. Both aspects are important as higher levels of acceptance of reduced speed limits are likely to lead to higher levels of compliance. In the absence of acceptance of reduced speed limits then higher levels of speed enforcement and more expensive engineering treatments are likely to be required to get better compliance. The paper presents the results of a literature review and web survey on the acceptance of reduced speed limits, in both urban and rural areas in New Zealand. The acceptance web survey examines drivers understanding of the effects of speed on crash occurrence, including more severe crashes. It seeks to understand drivers current speed choices in both low and high speed areas and their attitudes to reducing speed limits in various speed environments. Drivers are also asked about the type of supporting information that is often provided with reduced speed limits, such as safer speed areas, schools and high crash areas signage, and whether this will encourage them to slow down.",,"ITRD, ATRI",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Attitude, Attitude (psychol), Attitudes, Behavior, Computers, Driver behaviour, Drivers, Highway safety, Highways, Interviews, New Zealand, Online Survey, Road safety, Safe systems (roads), Speed control, Speed control, Speed limit, Speed limits, Surveys","Data and Information Technology, Highways, Law, Safety and Human Factors, I83: Accidents and the Human Factor",10/10/2014 9:39:00 AM,10/10/2014 9:39:00 AM,,13p,,"Turner, S","Bosher, S","Collier, M",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2014-08-00,,"Australian Institute of Traffic Planning and Management (AITPM) National Conference, 2014, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

SPECS3 POD (Portable Outstation Device) allows the expensive 'controllers' to be moved between a number of pre-prepared enforcement locations.

ARIMA time series analyses regarding crashes related to red-light running (right-angle crashes and rear-end crashes) and crashes related to speeding (injury crashes and property damage only crashes) occurring at intersections were conducted using monthly crash counts from 1994 to 2008. A quasi-experimental intersection camera experiment was also conducted using roadside data on speeding and red-light running behavior at intersections. These data were analyzed using logistic regression analysis. The time series analyses showed that for crashes related to red-light running, there had been a 46% decrease in right-angle crashes at camera intersections, but that there had also been an initial 42% increase in rear-end crashes. For crashes related to speeding, analyses revealed that the installation of cameras was not associated with increases or decreases in crashes. Results of the intersection camera experiment show that there were significantly fewer red light running violations at intersections after installation of cameras and that photo enforcement had a protective effect on speeding behavior at intersections. However, the data also suggest photo enforcement may be less effective in preventing serious speeding violations at intersections. Overall, Winnipeg's photo enforcement safety program had a positive net effect on traffic safety. Results from both the ARIMA time series and the quasi-experimental design corroborate one another.

1278616,01526986,Risk Factors Related to Fatal Truck Crashes on Korean Freeways,,DO,English,,,https://doi.org/10.1080/15389588.2013.778989,,,,,"The major purpose of this study was to identify risk factors affecting truck crashes on freeways and propose recommendations for safer truck traffic operations. Truck crashes were analyzed to identify how truck traffic safety is related to prevailing traffic and weather conditions. Prevailing traffic conditions were characterized by central tendencies and the spatiotemporal variation of traffic parameters collected from freeway traffic surveillance systems. A total of 377 truck crashes occurring on Korean freeways in a recent 3-year period, 2008–2010, were analyzed together with corresponding prevailing traffic conditions and weather conditions. Several statistical tests were conducted to understand the characteristics of prevailing traffic conditions before crash occurrence based on different weather conditions. In addition, a binary logistic regression technique was applied to identify causal factors affecting truck crash severity under normal and adverse weather conditions. Major findings from the analyses are discussed with truck operations strategies including speed enforcement, variable speed limit, and truck lane restriction from the safety enhancement point of view. Speed-related variables representing prevailing traffic conditions before crash occurrences were found to be the most statistically significant factors affecting truck crash severity, compared to volume-related variables such as the volume-to-capacity ratio (v/c). It is inferred that speed management is an effective tool for safer truck traffic operations on freeways. The major findings can be further discussed to derive valuable insights into truck traffic operations based on different weather conditions, such as normal and adverse. Some recommendations for safer truck traffic operations were presented based on the results obtained. The outcomes of this study could be effectively utilized to support the development of various traffic operations strategies and policies for truck traffic safety.",Abstract reprinted with permission of Taylor & Francis.,TRIS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Crash causes, Crash injuries, Fatalities, Highway operations, Injury severity, Korea, Lane occupancy, Speed, Traffic characteristics, Traffic safety, Traffic surveillance, Truck crashes, Truck lanes, Weather conditions","Highways, Safety and Human Factors, Vehicles and Equipment, I83: Accidents and the Human Factor, I91: Vehicle Design and Safety",11/28/2013 3:11:00 PM,5/29/2014 4:47:00 PM,Print,pp 73-80,,"Choi, Saerona","Oh, Cheol","Kim, MiJeong",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"References, Tables",2014-01-00,Traffic Injury Prevention,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Find a library where document is available,,,,,,,,,,,15,1,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

The  empirical Bayes (EB) and full Bayes (FB) methods have been widely used to assist such safety  assessment. However, the practical use of EB and FB methods are often limited because of the  extensive data needs from additional reference sites to develop safety performance functions (SPF).  To overcome this issue, this study proposes a new safety evaluation approach by expanding the  theory of survival analysis. A parametric Bayesian survival analysis model with a random effect  term to address the heterogeneity across sites is developed. As a case study, the proposed model  is used to evaluate the safety effectiveness of the recent red light running photo enforcement  program in the state of New Jersey. As demonstrated in the case study, the proposed approach  requires no data from reference sites. Using individual crashes as the analysis units, the survival  analysis explicitly accounts for time-dependent covariates and makes it feasible to include up-to- date crash data into models. In addition, the survival analysis, takes an appropriate consideration  of censoring effects, has the ability to address the regression-to-the-mean issue, and can be used  to capture the probability of crash occurrence beyond a specified time for study sites.","This paper was sponsored by TRB committee ANB20 Safety Data, Analysis and Evaluation.","TRIS, TRB, ATRI",14-1466,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bayes' theorem, Before and after studies, Case studies, Crash data, Mathematical models, New Jersey, Parametric analysis, Performance measurement, Photo enforcement, Red light running, Survival, Traffic law enforcement, Traffic safety","Highways, Planning and Forecasting, Safety and Human Factors, I72: Traffic and Transport Planning, I80: Accident Studies",1/27/2014 2:33:00 PM,3/26/2014 10:07:00 AM,Digital/other,14p,,"Xie, Kun","Ozbay, Kaan","Yang, Hong",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Figures, References, Tables",2014-00-00,,Transportation Research Board 93rd Annual Meeting,Transportation Research Board,,,,,,,,,,Transportation Research Board,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Transportation Research Board Business Office,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

To overcome these identified issues and better evaluate the effectiveness of some enforcement strategies, the authors used a new method, Quantile Regression, to analyze the speed data collected from a designed experiment.  Quantile Regression is capable of simultaneously estimating the entire distribution of speed, free of distributional assumption, and represents a significant improvement over the current methodologies. Quantile Regression was used in this study to estimate the effectiveness of police enforcement on speed control in work zones, and its strengths compared to traditional methodologies were fully demonstrated. New knowledge was obtained, and the best speed enforcement strategy was identified.

The survey was part of a larger study that accompanied the introduction of digital speed cameras in Israel. In terms of admitted speed violations, 34% of the drivers in 2010 but only 21% in 2011 reported that their driving speed was above the reported (perceived) speed limit. In terms of speed camera influence, the majority of drivers (57%) indicated some influence on their own driving. Correspondingly, the majority of drivers (62%) predicted positive impact of speed cameras on safety. The main stated explanation for speed limit violations  was time pressure, while the main stated explanation for respecting the speed limit was enforcement, rather than safety concerns. A wide variance in perceived speed limits suggests that drivers may not know what the speed limits really are.

1289262,01519668,Potential GPS-Observed Driving Behavior Exposure Metrics for Crash Risk Analysis,,DO,English,,,,,,,Transportation Research Board Annual Meeting 2014 Paper #14-4232,"Using second-by-second naturalistic data collected by a large fleet of global positioning system (GPS) instrumented vehicles,  a relationship among longitudinally-observed driving behavior and exposure metrics (mileage,  driving duration, speeding, hard acceleration or deceleration, cruise speed duration, unfamiliar  roadway exposure, left/right turn exposure, and crash location exposure) and numbers of crash  involvements was investigated. With the initially proposed 413 driving behavior exposure metrics,  this study identified 22 driving behavior exposure metrics that demonstrated significant  difference between the crash-involved and the crash-not-involved drivers after the statistical  analyses. Further, accompanied by the 22 driving behavior exposure metrics, the study  determined five most contributing metrics in predicting the potential crash involvement status of  individuals as the following: mileage in rural area during the afternoon, frequency of over-speed  activity (>= 15mph) per mile on arterials during the morning, frequency of hard deceleration (>=  6mph/s) per mile on local streets during the night, frequency of hard deceleration (>= 8mph/s) per  mile on freeways during the morning, and frequency of hard deceleration (>= 8mph/s) per mile  on freeways during the afternoon. Such GPS-observed driving behavior exposure metrics  supported existing safety campaigns such as anti-aggressive driving and speed enforcement to  reduce the risk and the number of future crashes. When combined with the automobile insurance  premium structure, these driving behavior and exposure metrics could be used to help drivers  rectify their driving habits and patterns through proper education and monitoring programs.  Immediate implantation of such driving metrics as part of safety measures is arduous due to  requirement of sophisticated and expensive data collection systems. However, the recent  advancement in mobile telecommunication technology would provide opportunities to monitor  individual driving activities for a long-time period.","This paper was sponsored by TRB committee ANB20 Safety Data, Analysis and Evaluation.","TRIS, TRB, ATRI",14-4232,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Automatic data collection systems, Behavior, Crash exposure, Crash risk forecasting, Drivers, Global Positioning System, Metrics (Quantitative assessment), Periods of the day, Speed, Traffic safety, Trip length","Data and Information Technology, Highways, Safety and Human Factors, I83: Accidents and the Human Factor",1/27/2014 3:27:00 PM,3/26/2014 10:07:00 AM,Digital/other,12p,,"Jun, Jungwook","Guensler, Randall","Ogle, Jennifer Harper",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"References, Tables",2014-00-00,,Transportation Research Board 93rd Annual Meeting,Transportation Research Board,,,,,,,,,,Transportation Research Board,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Transportation Research Board Business Office,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

Fatal work zone collisions in Saskatchewan remain statistically low and do not appear to be increasing; injury work zone collisions are trending upward. Collision analysis show inattention/distraction, road conditions, disregard for traffic control devices and speed are contributing factors in work zone collisions. To address the worker and motorist safety issues the MHI partnered with Saskatchewan Government Insurance (SGI) and the Ministry of Justice to facilitate the application of a safe systems framework that includes good engineering; strong legislation; adequate/visible enforcement; and timely and targeted education. Input was solicited from various stakeholders, including the general public, Saskatchewan Heavy Construction Association, police, cities, and the Saskatchewan Safety Council. The analysis of the input received confirmed four key objectives of the work zone safety enhancement study: to alleviate driver confusion; to enhance driver compliance; to improve jurisdictional consistency; and to enhance contractor compliance of the traffic accommodation specifications. The study team’s methodology included gathering stakeholder input, conducting literature searches, and a jurisdictional survey of provinces. The data gathered was analyzed and binned under the safe system’s categories: Engineering; Education; and Enforcement. Each item in the three categories was evaluated further based on its value to meeting the four main objectives. Further analysis included consideration of safety and mobility, legislative requirements and cost. The key changes to the TCDMWZ focused on the engineering aspect and included setting regulatory speed zones supplemented with black and white speed signs, the addition of rumble strips, gateway assemblies, and speed feedback signs on high volume long duration projects. Legislation was changed to allow for Automated Speed Enforcement (photo radar) in work zones and tripling of fines for speeding. To improve education SGI made changes to the driver handbook, while MHI launched a new work zone campaign focusing on regulatory speeds in work zones. Training for contractors and Ministry maintenance staff was provided on the new signing regime and other changes in the TCDMWZ. Continuing work is focused on improving work zone signage, consistency between MHI and cities in Saskatchewan, and enhancements to the mobile (maintenance) work zones.

1341370,01552550,Effective Road Safety Management Using Network-wide Historical Speed Data – Commercial Speed Data as Big Data Source to Improve Road Safety Intelligence,,DO,English,,,https://aetransport.org/past-etc-papers/conference-papers-2014,,,,,"Commercial map data providers are offering custom speed data in selected countries. As opposed to speed data coming from measurement devices, this data was gathered by analyzing a large number of vehicle global positioning system (GPS) trajectories. A major advantage of this big data approach is the general availability of the data on the whole road network (some limitations apply) instead of just punctual information or for predefined routes like when travel time data is collected by Bluetooth device tracking. Another advantage is the effortless and fast availability of the data. Some negative aspects of this kind of data exist and are addressed in the full presentation. The data available allows for a custom definition of date period (data is generally available from 2008 depending on region/country in the case of TomTom data), weekly hour groups within this period (e.g. weekday morning peak, Friday & Saturday night,...) and for freely definable routes within the road network. For this kind of data, also the per segment speed distribution in 5-percentile steps is provided, allowing the analysis of V85 values and more. The authors have tested this data (“Custom Travel Time” data by TomTom) and identified the following use cases and benefits for the road safety researcher and practitioner: (1) Comparison of design speeds with actual driving speeds. Roads are generally designed to safely handle a predefined posted speed and in turn maximum expected speed. In most cases a corresponding speed limit is explicitly posted or implicitly given, but this is not always the case. Also, over time, changes in maximum speed limits can occur or the speeding likelihood may change. In turn, a mismatch between initial design speed and the speeds generally driven might arise. Speed data can now be used to evaluate network elements where such discrepancies occur. The introduction of a new speed limit regime or the upgrading of those parts of the network where the speeding behavior does not match the design speed can be focus of a “Systemic Safety Approach” to improve the inherent safety performance of this part of the network. (2) Assess the effect of road infrastructure changes or speed enforcement tactics on the driving speeds at the site and in its vicinity. For many crash black spot treatments, speed reduction is a main goal. However it is hard to evaluate the long term effect of any measure at the treatment site and its surroundings. Speed data can now be used to get an indication of the historical speed distribution as well as the changes in speeds after implementation of the treatment. This is – in addition to what is possible with traditional single location speed camera measurements – available also in adjacent parts of the road network. (3) Analyze the general speeding behavior at crash sites where speed is a possible contributing factor. If speeding was a contributing factor of a crash is not always easy to assess. In turn, the quality of this attribute in crash data – if available – is mediocre at best. Commercial speed data can help to identify if speeding is generally a problem at a high risk section and at what times. (4) Check necessity for posting a general speed limit as opposed to time dependent speed limit changes. Building on top of the previous use case, if knowledge is available on when critical speeding occurs, the road administration has the option to consider temporal speed limits (e.g. only at night times), which might be in line with local or regional policy to not impose “unnecessary” speed limitations while at the same time consider road safety aspects. (5) Calibration of microsimulations to better model the real driving behavior. The use of microsimulation software to assess safety levels is a growing trend among researchers and consultancies specialized in road safety evaluations. The most common toolset for this (as observed at Road Safety and Simulation conference 2013 in Rome or Transportation Research Board Annual Meeting 2014 in Washington) is PTV Vissim as microsimulation software and SSAM as analytical engine for surrogate measures to assess safety. While PTV Vissim offers a default driving behavior and speed distribution functions, the quality of the model (i.e. how well the model simulates ""real"" driving behavior) can be increased by using local speed distributions from the commercially available speed data as input. Also, total travel times can be compared between the model output and the measured data to calibrate iteratively.",Abstract used by permission of Association for European Transport.,TRIS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Behavior, Bluetooth technology, Crash causes, Global Positioning System, Highway safety, Microsimulation, Speed data, TomTom, Travel time","Data and Information Technology, Highways, Safety and Human Factors, I85: Safety Devices used in Transport Infrastructure",1/22/2015 4:46:00 PM,2/2/2015 10:27:00 AM,Digital/other,16p,,"Hoffmann, Timo","Hitscherich, Karin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Figures, Maps",2014-00-00,,European Transport Conference 2014,Association for European Transport (AET),,,,,,,,,,Association for European Transport (AET),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

1308308,01527811,An Online Self-Learning Algorithm for License Plate Matching,,DO,English,,,https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2013.2270107,,,,,"License plate recognition (LPR) technology is a mature yet imperfect technology used for automated toll collection and speed enforcement. The portion of license plates that can be correctly recognized and matched at two separate stations is typically in the range of 35% or less. Existing methods for improving the matching of plates recognized by LPR units rely on intensive manual data reduction, such that the misread plates are manually entered into the system. Recently, an advanced matching technique that combines Bayesian probability and Levenshtein text-mining techniques was proposed to increase the accuracy of automated license plate matching. The key component of this method is what the authors call the association matrix, which contains the conditional probabilities of observing one character at one station for a given observed character at another station. However, the estimation of the association matrix relies on the manually extracted ground truth of a large number of plates, which is a cumbersome and tedious process. To overcome this drawback, in this study, the authors propose an ingenious novel self-learning algorithm that eliminates the need for extracting ground truth manually.

They are the fourth leading cause of premature death in the country and are responsible for 2.4% of the burden of non-fatal health loss in the country. Interventions to curb speeding and drink driving are being implemented in the cities of Suzhou and Dalian since late 2010. The authors evaluated the ongoing effect of these activities through five roadside surveys, seven rounds of observational studies, and analysis of crash statistics in the two cities. The authors find that thus far, the prevalence of speeding has not reduced in either city with the notable exception of one site in Dalian, where the percentage of speeding vehicles declined from nearly 70% to below 10% after an interval-based speed enforcement system was installed. The broader deployment of such speed control technologies across China and other countries should be explored. Roadside alcohol testing suggests that prevalence of drink driving prevalence (i.e. BAC >20 mg%) declined from 6.4% to 0.5% in Suzhou and from 1.7% to 0.7% in Dalian during the monitored time period. However, the measured prevalence rates are very low and should be validated against estimates based on hospital studies. Roadside interviews suggest that the population of both cities is already highly sensitized to the risks associated with drink driving and speeding. Crash statistics from the two cities do not show appreciable declines in injuries and fatalities as yet. However, the possibility of substantial underreporting in crash statistics sourced from traffic police poses a severe threat to monitoring progress towards road safety in Suzhou, Dalian and across China. There is an urgent need for China to invest in a reliable road traffic injury surveillance system that can provide information for describing key risk factors, evaluating the impact of safety policies, and benchmarking achievements.",Abstract reprinted with permission of Elsevier.,TRIS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Dalian (China), Drunk driving, Evaluation, Fatalities, Highway safety, Safety programs, Speeding, Suzhou (China), Traffic crash victims, Traffic law enforcement","Highways, Safety and Human Factors, I83: Accidents and the Human Factor",5/9/2014 1:00:00 PM,5/29/2014 10:18:00 AM,Web,pp S49-S56,,"Bhalla, Kavi","Li, Qingfeng","Duan, Leilen","Wang, Yuan","Bishai, David","Hyder, Adnan A",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Figures, References, Tables",2013-12-00,Injury,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Find a library where document is available,,,,,,,,,,,44,Supplement 4,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

It is widely acknowledged that mass media and public education initiatives have played a critical role in the significant positive changes witnessed in community attitudes to road safety in the last three to four decades. It could be argued that mass media and education have had a direct influence on behaviours and attitudes, as well as an indirect influence through signposting and awareness raising functions in conjunction with enforcement. Great achievements have been made in reducing fatalities on Australia&rsquo;s roads; a concept which is well understood among the international road safety fraternity. How well these achievements are appreciated by the general Australian community however, is not clear. This paper explores the lessons that can be learnt from successes in attitudinal and behaviour change in regard to seatbelt use and drink driving in Australia. It also identifies and discusses key challenges associated with achieving further positive changes in community attitudes and behaviours, particularly in relation to behaviours that may not be perceived by the community as dangerous, such as speeding and mobile phone use while driving. Potential strategies for future mass media and public education campaigns to target these challenges are suggested, including ways of harnessing the power of contemporary traffic law enforcement techniques, such as point-to-point speed enforcement and in-vehicle technologies, to help spread the road safety message.",,"ITRD, ATRI",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Attitude, Attitude (psychol), Attitudes, Australia, Behavior, Driver behaviour, Drivers, Education, Enforcement (law), Law enforcement, Law enforcement, Publicity, Publicity, Road user, Road user education, Safe systems (road users), Traffic safety education","Security and Emergencies, I83: Accidents and the Human Factor",2/20/2014 10:15:00 AM,2/20/2014 10:15:00 AM,,13p,,"Fleiter, J J","Lewis, I","Watson, B",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2013-11-00,,"Australasian College of Road Safety Conference, 2013, Adelaide, South Australia,  Australia",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

However, the interventions to redress this continuing serious threat to public safety are amongst the most controversial done by governments in Australia. Media outcries of ""revenue raising"" when speed cameras are installed are deafening. This is despite the voluminous evidence that speed cameras save lives. In early 2012 there were a number of current affairs programs on commercial TV channels and web internet discussions that were blatantly anti-speed camera enforcement. Expert road safety researchers have attempted to present the facts and provide evidence-based opinions about the injury risks of speeding and the safety benefits of speed camera enforcement. Australian community surveys have indicated that the majority of people do understand that speeding is a road safety risk, and they support speed limits and speed enforcement. But broad public and media understanding of the issues are still confounded by misleading publicity and opinionated nonexpert mass and social media discussions of views opposing speed enforcement and even views that disagree that speeding is a road trauma risk.

The manual review process can be expensive, error prone and may involve only a fraction of the images actually captured. To address this problem, the authors present algorithmic tools that can be used to automatically review images to detect any potential camera faults, thus, reduce human workload and increase maintenance efficiency.

Log linear analysis was used and four models were developed: for motorways, main roads, country roads and built-up area roads. The model application revealed that the dependent variable (self-reported exceeding the speed limit) is strongly dependent on the belief that other drivers exceed speed limits for all four road types. Other variables found to have an impact on the attitude towards exceeding speed limits concern driver characteristics (gender, age group, annual kilometrage), opinions (enjoyment of driving fast, the expectation of speed enforcement and wishes for higher limits) and self-reported behavior (having received penalty for speeding) and other parameters (engine capacity of its car, signalling others about police trap).",© 2013 George Yannis et al.,TRIS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Arterial highways, Attitudes, Behavior, Drivers, Driving, Europe, Freeways, Highway safety, Speed limits, Speeding","Highways, Safety and Human Factors, I83: Accidents and the Human Factor",9/13/2013 1:43:00 PM,9/18/2013 3:08:00 PM,Digital/other,pp 165-177,,"Yannis, George","Louca, Georgia","Vardaki, Sophia","Kanellaidis, George",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Figures, References, Tables",2013-09-00,European Transport Research Review,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Find a library where document is available,,,,,,,,,,,5,3,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

Two signal-controlled crossings were continuously videoed. When an accident was reported to the alarm center, the tape was taken to detailed inspection. From the video recordings, the positions of the participants were precisely known, and their speeds before and at the moment of collision could be calculated. Also information on vehicles not directly involved into the accident could be collected. The main result was the primary importance of the speeds of free flowing vehicles. A reduction of the speeds effects the free, most dangerous vehicles, whereas the effect on travel times for the majority in queues on congested streets in central areas is very small. Based on accident tapes and the stories of victims it was also concluded that pedestrians run over when walking or running against red light did not pay any attention to the approaching vehicle. This gave a pessimistic outlook on efforts to reduce pedestrian accidents by improving pedestrian behaviour. 1992 and 1996 the speed limit on Kaivokatu street, Helsinki, with 30.000 vehicles and 100.000 crossing pedestrians was reduced to finally 30 km/h. 2008 automatic speed enforcement cameras were installed.

While excessive speeding is typically regarded by the public as a common contributing factor in road crashes, speeding remains a common traffic infringement and an arguably socially acceptable behaviour, particularly at low levels over the speed limit. This suggests that other factors potentially contribute to this disparity between crash perceptions and actual behaviours. Previous work has described associations between perceptions of the legitimacy of speed enforcement, attitudes, and how they relate to the likelihood of speeding. This study sought to more closely examine the nature of the relationships between these variables. In total, 293 Queensland drivers participated in a study that examined how demographics, personality variables, attitudes, and perceptions of the legitimacy of enforcement contributed to drivers&rsquo; self-reported likelihood of speeding. Results suggested that positive attitudes towards speeding had the greatest impact on likelihood of speeding behaviours. Being younger and higher levels of the personality trait of extraversion were also associated with greater levels of self-reported likelihood of speeding. Attitudes were found to mediate the relationship between perceived legitimacy of speed enforcement and self-reported likelihood of speeding. A subgroup analysis of participants with positive and negative attitudes towards speeding revealed that a differential set of variables were predictive of self-reported likelihood of speeding for the two subgroups. This highlights the potential importance of attitudes in understanding the influence of perceptions of legitimacy of speed enforcement on speeding behaviour, and the need for targeted rather than a &lsquo;one size fits all&rsquo; approach to changing attitudes and ultimately behaviour.

In 2011 a quantitative telephone survey of 1,500 NSW drivers measured changes since the 2009 study, and explored other speeding issues of emerging interest. The 2009 study showed that speeding was not yet socially unacceptable, except in extreme cases. Findings from the 2011 study suggest that the situation may be gradually improving, with small reductions in the perceived acceptability of speeding, albeit only in lower speed zones. There has also been a shift towards drivers reporting exceeding the speed limit by a smaller average margin, and by a smaller maximum margin. Consistent with 2009 findings, the 2011 study identified that there continues to be a high level of support for existing speed enforcement practices in NSW, including mobile speed cameras, as well as practices in other jurisdictions. Findings show that there is more community support for marked mobile speed cameras than for fixed speed cameras not in school zones. However, there still remains a perception of revenue raising.

1279338,01500853,Driving attitudes and risk perceptions of high-frequency speeders: Results of a community attitudes survey,,DO,English,,,http://acrs.org.au/publications/conference-papers/database/,,,ARRB,,"Crashes involving speeding drivers and riders resulted in 59 fatalities in Queensland in 2012, representing 21.1 per cent of the annual road toll. Research has found exceeding the speed limit by just 5km/h doubles the risk of being involved in a casualty crash. As such, frequent speeding even at a low range has the potential to be dangerous. However, despite the evidence of risk, speeding continues to be a pervasive factor on Queensland roads. Speeding remains relatively socially acceptable and is practiced by most drivers on occasion. Correcting this mismatch between the risks associated with speeding and driver behaviour is an essential step in making speeding socially unacceptable. The Department of Transport and Main Roads has conducted an annual community attitudes survey for the past 14 years which is used to track self-reported attitudes to various road safety issues and assist policy makers to develop appropriate interventions to curb negative and antisocial attitudes. This study combined the results of the three most recent surveys, 2010 - 2012 and examined the self-reported attitudes, risk perceptions and behaviour of high frequency speeders (i.e. those who report speeding more than 50 percent of the time). High frequency speeders tended to be younger than low-frequency speeders and held less safe attitudes towards all speeding and speed enforcement items surveyed. The situations in which high-frequency speeders were more likely to report speeding pointed to the fact that the behaviour was often a conscious decision. Risk perceptions of other road safety issues were also investigated. Implications for public policy are discussed.",,"ITRD, ATRI",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Accident prevention, Attitude, Attitude (psychol), Attitudes, Australia, Behavior, Computers, Crash analysis, Crash analysis, Crash countermeasure, Data acquisition, Driver behaviour, Drivers, Online Survey, Queensland, Safe systems (road users), Speeding, Speeding, Surveys, Traffic safety","Safety and Human Factors, I83: Accidents and the Human Factor",12/5/2013 8:51:00 AM,12/5/2013 8:51:00 AM,,13p,,"Mackay, N L","Knight, L L","Leal, N",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2013-08-00,,"Australasian Road Safety Research Policing Education Conference, 2013, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

Excessive speeding through work and maintenance zones is a common occurrence which elevates the dangers to both drivers and motorists in the work zone. Although most work zones are controlled by reduced speed limits or state law enforcement, driver adherence to these regulations and laws in very minimal, especially in work zones. Several studies have shown a correlation between speeding in work zones and traffic crashes which lead most traffic safety professionals to conclude that excessive speeding and speed variance are the contributing factors in a large percentage of traffic crashes, injuries or fatalities. The most influential factor in achieving speed compliance in the work zone is the driver’s perception of heightened risk. The main objective of this study was to determine the safest and most effective countermeasure for the reduction of vehicular speeds within construction and maintenance work zones. The purpose of the simulator experiment was to determine the effectiveness of 20 countermeasures on the reduction of speed through work zones in a controlled laboratory setting. The literature review identified several past research studies utilizing speed reduction countermeasures in work zones and under normal traffic conditions. From this review, 20 countermeasures were selected for evaluation based upon discussions with ODOT personnel. The post hoc tests indicated that the presence of construction workers, presence of construction vehicles, law enforcement, speed photo enforcement and shifting lanes were most effective at reducing speeds in work zones. The least effective speed reduction countermeasures included 3 sets of 3 rumble strips, concrete barriers, other channelizing devices and changeable message signs with speed reductions less than 10 mph.",,"TRIS, ATRI, USDOT, STATEDOT",FHWA/OH-2013/5,,,,,,,,,,SJN 134625,,,,,,,,,,"Countermeasures, Driving simulators, Ohio, Speed control, Speeding, Virtual reality, Work zone safety, Work zone traffic control, Work zones","Highways, Operations and Traffic Management, Safety and Human Factors, I73: Traffic Control",8/29/2013 7:41:00 AM,9/19/2013 12:16:00 PM,Digital/other,78p,,"Sommers, Norman M","McAvoy, Deborah S",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Appendices, Figures, References, Tables",2013-06-00,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ohio University, Athens",Ohio Department of Transportation,Federal Highway Administration,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,National Technical Information Service,,,,,,,,,,,,,Final Report,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

This paper reviews the evidence regarding the impact of this approach on vehicle speeds, crash rates and a number of additional road safety and public health outcomes. The economic and practical viability of the approach as a road safety countermeasure is also explored. A literature review, with an international scope, of both published and grey literature was conducted. There is a growing body of evidence to suggest a number of road safety benefits associated with average speed enforcement, including high rates of compliance with speed limits, reductions in average and 85th percentile speeds and reduced speed variability between vehicles. Moreover, the approach has been demonstrated to be particularly effective in reducing excessive speeding behaviour. Reductions in crash rates have also been reported in association with average speed enforcement, particularly in relation to fatal and serious injury crashes. In addition, the approach has been shown to improve traffic flow, reduce vehicle emissions and has also been associated with high levels of public acceptance. Average speed enforcement offers a greater network-wide approach to managing speeds that reduces the impact of time and distance halo effects associated with other automated speed enforcement approaches.

The study found that it is common for drivers to think that other drivers who drive faster than they do are a safety threat, but they mostly see their own driving as being under control and therefore &lsquo;safe enough&rsquo;.  In discussion groups, drivers indicated that the fear of being caught was usually the most salient negative consequence of speeding, and was therefore the most prominent consideration in choosing driving speed.  Overall, enforcement by police was widely supported by drivers and claimed to be more effective than automatic enforcement.  The effectiveness of covert enforcement was generally not well understood and it received lower levels of approval than overt techniques.  More survey respondents reported that they were deterred by the threat of immediate licence suspension than by a fine or demerit points.

1244355,01473869,Mobile Phone Use and Traffic Characteristics,,DO,English,,,,,,,,"This article analyzes the impact of mobile phone use on vehicle traffic speed and headways. Unlike most related studies that are based on either questionnaire responses or driving simulator experiments, a field survey was conducted in real traffic conditions. In particular, traffic data were recorded on a four-lane urban arterial highway segment using a video camera and a speed gun. Linear regression models were developed for the analysis of the effect of cell phone use and other variables on traffic speed and time/space headways. The article found that vehicle speed is increased by young drivers (aged 18-25 years), male and taxi drivers, and decreased for older drivers (>55 years) and for drivers using their mobile phones while driving. Vehicle time headways were not found to be affected by cell phone use. However, headspaces, estimated as the product of vehicle speed and time headways, were found to be decreased for drivers using their mobile phone, young and older drivers. Overall, drivers between 25 and 55 years old are associated with larger space headways regardless of the use of a mobile phone, which is possible due to a combination of adequate driving experience and skills. The article discusses how mobile phone use results in lower speeds, which suggests a driver’s compensatory effect on the distraction caused by the mobile phone use. This distraction is also reflected in the reduced space headways that are associated with cell phone use for all drivers. The reduction is more pronounced when the speed and headway difference between successive vehicles was not significant in the first place, which is the case for vehicle platoons.",,TRIS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Cellular telephones, Distraction, Headways, Linear regression analysis, Traffic characteristics, Traffic data, Traffic speed","Highways, Operations and Traffic Management, Safety and Human Factors, I72: Traffic and Transport Planning, I83: Accidents and the Human Factor",2/25/2013 12:42:00 PM,2/26/2013 10:25:00 AM,Print,pp 7-11,,"Yannis, George","Papantoniou, P Panagiotis","Petrellis, Nikolaos",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Figures, Photos, References, Tables",2013-01-00,Traffic Engineering & Control,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Find a library where document is available,,,,,,,,,,,54,1,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

The main recommendations for improving road safety in the U.S. are as follows: (1) lower states’ BAC limits to 0.5 g/l and introduce effective random breath testing, (2) reexamine the current speed-limit policies and improve speed enforcement, (3) implement primary seat-belt-wearing laws in each state that would cover both front and rear occupants, and reward vehicle manufacturers for installation of advanced seat-belt reminders, (4) reconsider road-safety target setting so that the focus is on reducing fatalities and not on reducing fatality rate per distance driven, and (5) consider new strategies to reduce vehicle distance driven.",,TRIS,UMTRI-2013-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Best practices, Crash causes, Crash data, Fatalities, Highway safety, Injury rates, Netherlands, Safety management, Sweden, United Kingdom, United States","Data and Information Technology, Highways, Safety and Human Factors, I80: Accident Studies",1/24/2013 10:23:00 AM,3/8/2013 3:51:00 PM,Digital/other,34p,,"Luoma, Juha","Sivak, Michael",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Figures, References, Tables",2013-01-00,,,,,,,,,,,,,University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,National Technical Information Service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

Speeding accounts for about 10% of fatalities, which represents a large decrease from a peak of 17.2% in 2004. Speeding has been addressed at a national level through the introduction of laws and procedural requirements in 2004, in provinces either across all road types or on motorways, and at city level. Typically, documentation of speed enforcement programs has taken place when new technology (i.e. speed cameras) is introduced, and it is likely that many programs have not been documented or widely reported. In particular, the national legislation of 2004 and its implementation was associated with a large reduction in fatalities attributed to speeding. In Guangdong Province, after using speed detection equipment, motorway fatalities due to speeding in 2005 decreased by 32.5% comparing with 2004. In Beijing, the number of traffic monitoring units which were used to photograph illegal traffic activities such as traffic light violations, speeding and using bus lanes illegally increased to 1958 by April 1, 2009, and in the future such automated enforcement will become the main means of enforcement, expected to account for 60% of all traffic enforcement in Beijing.

An opportunity presented itself to evaluate what would happen to red light running behavior at formerly enforced locations. Using intersections previously studied to document one city's deployment and use of photo enforcement (see Martinez and Porter, 2006), the authors mobilized multiple pre-expiration, immediate post-expiration, and one year post-expiration observations at camera-enforced intersections as well as two control groups consisting of same-city and a different city's non-camera locations. More than 2700 direct observations were made in these time periods, documenting the near-immediate increase in red light running at previously camera-enforced intersections. These intersections had a rate that nearly tripled immediately after the law expired, and more than quadrupled one year later. Further, within a year of the law's expiration, the low red light running rates at the previous-camera locations had recidivated to red light running rates of the control locations. Driver characteristics were not significant predictors of these rates once intersection group and traffic volume (and their interaction) were controlled, meaning red light running in this study was not linked to a particular driver type.

In an effort to improve work zone safety now and in the future, the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) recently established a special fund for work zone speed enforcement and further commissioned the authors of this study to help them achieve the maximum safety benefits within their budget constraint. A previous study by the authors modeled the crash frequency in Indiana work zones with various features, which provided the potential for safety improvement. In this study, the focus is on evaluating the effectiveness of police enforcement strategies in reducing driving speed in work zones. These results will eventually be included in a comprehensive method for optimizing enforcement strategies and resource allocation to improve work zone safety. Different combinations of stationary police enforcement, with or without supplemental variable message signs (VMS), were evaluated in six work zone sites. The authors conducted data collection using experiment design techniques and multilevel linear modeling for the data analysis with the goal of finding the best way to estimate the effectiveness of enforcement strategies. The developed statistical model allows predicting speed reduction as a function of police enforcement elements and roadway characteristics. The results indicate that spreading enforcement resources among multiple work zones is a good strategy instead of concentrating enforcement on a smaller number of work zones. Furthermore, adding VMS with relevant messages about enforcement greatly increases the effectiveness of the enforcement program.",This paper was sponsored by TRB committee ANB40 Traffic Law Enforcement.,"PRP, TRIS, TRB, ATRI",13-0927,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Highway safety, Indiana Department of Transportation, Mathematical prediction, Police patrol, Resource allocation, Speeding, Traffic law enforcement, Variable message signs, Work zone safety","Highways, Safety and Human Factors, I82: Accidents and Transport Infrastructure, I85: Safety Devices used in Transport Infrastructure",2/5/2013 12:17:00 PM,3/18/2013 10:10:00 AM,Digital/other,20p,,"Chen, Erdong","Tarko, Andrew P",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Figures, References, Tables",2013-00-00,,Transportation Research Board 92nd Annual Meeting,Transportation Research Board,,,,,,,,,,Transportation Research Board,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Transportation Research Board Business Office,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

The data collection scheme utilized two locations to characterize the effects near the treatment and 1.5 miles downstream. Vehicle observations from the two locations were matched. The paired data were used to analyze the speed change behavior of vehicles between the two data collection locations as a result of the speed control treatments, vehicle type, and lane type. Paired t-tests revealed statistically significant speed increases of 6.1 mph and 5.4 mph between the treatment and downstream locations for Police and SPE, respectively; the speed change for Base condition was not statistically different than 0 mph. The magnitude of average speed change of each treatment was statistically different from each of the others. Travel lane at the treatment location was not a significant factor in speed change but vehicle type (passenger car or heavy vehicle) was a significant factor. Passenger cars had a higher average speed change than heavy vehicles for Police and SPE but lower average speed change for Base. An overwhelming percentage of drivers sped up after treatment in Police (92%) and SPE (85%) while only 48% sped up in the base condition. In Police and SPE, 57% and 54% of drivers were not speeding at the treatment location but sped up such that they were speeding at the downstream; only 13% of the Base group showed this behavior.",This paper was sponsored by TRB committee AHB55 Work Zone Traffic Control.,"TRIS, TRB, ATRI",13-4339,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Cameras, Data collection, Illinois, Police patrol, Speed control, Speeding, Traffic lanes, Work zones","Highways, Operations and Traffic Management, I73: Traffic Control",2/5/2013 12:50:00 PM,4/15/2013 1:14:00 PM,Digital/other,12p,,"Lodes, Michael","Benekohal, Rahim F",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Figures, Photos, References, Tables",2013-00-00,,Transportation Research Board 92nd Annual Meeting,Transportation Research Board,,,,,,,,,,Transportation Research Board,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Transportation Research Board Business Office,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

Analyses of the contribution of various levels of speeding to the road toll are reviewed, demonstrating that low level speeding (within 10km/h of the speed limit) is a major contributor to death and injury. However, speeding, especially low level speeding, remains socially acceptable and commonly practiced by most Australians and is broadly accepted and practiced by drivers throughout the world.  This paper reviews evidence of attitudes and beliefs which engender low level speeding from surveys and social media, to suggest policy revisions which may help address this behavior and its social acceptability, including low tolerances on speed enforcement, escalating penalties for repeat offending as occurs with drink-driving, and penalties more aligned with real risks compared with other risky behaviors.  These policies not only directly address low level speeding through deterrence, but also send messages which counter currently held unhelpful beliefs. Additional messages on the accuracy of speedometers and speed detection devices, and the costs of low level speeding to the community, may also be helpful.","This paper was sponsored by TRB committee ANB20 Safety Data, Analysis and Evaluation.","TRIS, TRB, ATRI",13-5247,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Australia, Behavior, Fatalities, Injuries, Perception, Social media, Speed detectors, Speeding, Speedometers","Highways, Safety and Human Factors, I83: Accidents and the Human Factor",2/5/2013 12:59:00 PM,4/1/2013 10:53:00 AM,Digital/other,17p,,"Job, Soames","Sakashita, Chika","Mooren, Lori","Grzebieta, Raphael",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Figures, References, Tables",2013-00-00,,Transportation Research Board 92nd Annual Meeting,Transportation Research Board,,,,,,,,,,Transportation Research Board,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Transportation Research Board Business Office,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

1243107,01477218,The Effect of Speed Control with a Mobile Radar With or Without an Advanced Warning Sign: A Statistical Analysis on Speeding Behavior,,DO,English,,,,,,,Transportation Research Board Annual Meeting 2013 Paper #13-5358,"Speeding is an important risk factor in road safety. Generally, this risk factor plays a role in one out of three fatal crashes. Speed enforcement is one of the measures to tackle this problem. In this paper, the authors investigate the effect of a stationary police control in an unmarked police car equipped with a mobile radar with and without an advance warning sign alongside the road section. These two methods were tested on two road segments of regional roads (70 km/h and 90 km/h) in the Flemish region of Belgium by means of two field experiments.  Since the use of a warning sign raises the visibility of the covert speed control the authors assume - partly based on previous research - that the effect on speeding behavior will be higher and longer lasting (than without the advance warning sign).  The effect of both methods is evaluated by means of descriptive analyses, significance tests and multiple linear regression analyses. In this paper, the authors present the results of these analyses with respect to a frequently used speed behavioral indicator namely the 85th percentile of speed (“V85”). Analysis of the general effect of both enforcement methods, show a larger effect of the speed control with advanced warning sign (- 10 km/h) than for the speed control only (- 5 km/h). Results with regard to the effect in time are less conclusive.

To achieve this level of safety through an automated system, certain worst case assumptions must be made regarding train performance and track conditions that are not known to the system. There is also error that is inherent in train location information available to the PTC system which must be accounted for. For these reasons, trains will perform differently in the presence of a PTC system than they would if these operating conditions were left to be enforced by the engineer through adherence to rules and instructions. These differences in train performance will have an impact on train operations in the future under various PTC implementations. There are also design and implementation decisions that can affect and potentially alleviate some of these performance impacts. Until these various PTC implementations are in operation the only way to truly know the extent of these impacts and the potential benefit of various design decisions is through  simulation. This paper will discuss the simulation of train operations under a system without PTC installed and under the same system with PTC installed.

As a number of technologies have rapidly advanced, including photo enforcement, electronic tolling, vehicle-mile taxing, weigh-in-motion, and Connected Vehicle technologies, research examining the privacy implications of system applications has lagged. In a recent national survey to determine how state departments of transportation (DOTs) are meeting the privacy needs of the traveling public, it was determined that DOTs favor aggregating and masking data for protecting privacy of motorists while collecting travel times and speeds. For capturing video surveillance, abiding by legislation or agency policies was the preferred method of protecting privacy. Unfortunately, there are no national standards in the US for the privacy protection of travelers as most privacy information merely takes the form of poorly defined precepts. With the increasing use of ITS applications, which are becoming more interwoven into the US transportation grid, there is a need to develop a national policy and related standards to ensure the privacy protection of the traveling public to ensure broader acceptance of ITS applications.

1249218,01480247,Changing the road policing investment conversation: targeting to risk and finding tradeoffs,,DO,English,,,http://acrs.org.au/publications/conference-papers/database/,,,ARRB,,"The NZ Transport Agency and NZ Police identified that road policing could be better targeted to risk, use outcomes rather than outputs, implement a safe system approach, and align the programme to Safer Journeys.  This resulted in both agencies reconsidering road safety risk and discussing how NZ Police can better target to risk with the resources and equipment available.  In 2011, the NZ Transport Agency and NZ Police developed a road policing programme that focused on the contribution policing makes to road safety outcomes.  It targets police activities to localities, communities, people, routes and times of greatest risk.  It seeks to increase resource efficiency and effectiveness, and to provide a better understanding of the trade-offs between activities, for example restraint enforcement vs speed enforcement.  The 2011/12 programme was a first step in a new conversation.  As the model of investing in policing to deliver a desired set of road safety outcomes develops, challenges include: determining how technology can increase efficiency and effectiveness; deciding which enforcement activities require police officers; finding appropriate performance measures which reflect Police strengths; and adapting road policing to a safe system and Prevention First approach.

The major research activities were undertaken for the preparation of this report included: (1) an extensive review of the international literature; (2) stakeholder consultation with international and domestic organisations.  Evidence from other countries has revealed a number of positive findings including: (i) reductions in average/mean speeds, 85th percentile speeds, the proportion of speeding vehicles and speed variability; (ii) reductions in all crash types, particularly fatal and serious injury crashes; (iii) more homogenised traffic flow and increased traffic capacity resulting from reduced vehicle speed variability and subsequent increased headway; (iv) some evidence of reductions in traffic noise and harmful vehicle emissions; (v) positive attitudes of motorists towards the use of the approach; and (vi) long-term net economic benefits.  While methodological limitations are noted across the majority of the published evaluations, the consistency of positive findings is encouraging.  Stakeholder consultations investigated the extent to which point-to-point speed enforcement has been used throughout the world, the technological characteristics of systems used, operational requirements, as well as legislative and broader speed management issues.  Based on the findings reported from the stakeholder consultations and literature review, a number of recommendations for better practice are suggested in relation to the development and implementation of point-to-point speed enforcement systems in Australia and New Zealand relating to: (i) operational recommendations; (ii) technological recommendations; (iii) legislative recommendations; (iv) public education recommendations; (v) evaluation recommendations; and, (vi) privacy recommendations.",Austroads Project SS1649,"ITRD, ATRI",AP-R415/12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Australia, Automated enforcement, Automatic vehicle identification, Automatic vehicle identification (AVI), Cameras, Data collection, Enforcement (law), Highway traffic control, International, International comparison, International comparison, Interview, Interviews, Law enforcement, Law enforcement, License plates, Literature review, Literature reviews, New Zealand, Number plate, Speed camera, Speed control, Speed control, Speed limits, Traffic management","Security and Emergencies, I83: Accidents and the Human Factor",11/1/2012 2:34:00 PM,11/1/2012 2:34:00 PM,,165p,,"Soole, D W","Fleiter, J","Watson, B",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2012-09-00,,,,,,,,,,,,,Austroads,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Find a library where document is available,,,,,,,,,,9781921991424,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

In particular, they need to remain functional in low ambient illumination conditions (nighttime and cloudy day situations) to enable identification of objects or persons involved in incidents being monitored or extracting relevant information. Over time, for installed camera systems in the field, several problems can develop, such as external flash unit failures, focus drifts, and exposure issues. Thus, it is important to periodically monitor the nighttime images/videos taken by the camera system to ensure nominal functionality. However, due to constantly changing scene elements, it is not practical to compare a historical reference image with an identical scene against current camera output to detect problems. To address this, the authors present image quality metrics that can be extracted without a nominal reference image and can be used to characterize these problems.

In these fielded systems, a variety of factors can cause camera obstructions and persistent view changes that may adversely affect their performance. Examples include camera misalignment, intentional blockage resulting from vandalism, and natural elements causing obstruction, such as foliage growing into the scene and ice forming on the porthole. In addition, other persistent view changes resulting from new scene elements of interest being captured, such as stalled cars, suspicious packages, etc. might warrant alarms. Since these systems are often unattended, it is often important to automatically detect such incidents early. In this paper, the authors describe innovative algorithms to address these problems. A novel approach that uses the image edge map to detect near-field obstructions without a reference image of the unobstructed scene is presented. A second algorithm that can be used to detect more generic obstructions and persistent view changes using a learned scene element cluster map is then discussed. Lastly, an approach to detect and distinguish persistent view changes from changes in the orientation of the fixed camera system is explained. Together, these algorithms can be useful in a variety of camera-based ITS.",Abstract reprinted with permission of IEEE.,TRIS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Algorithms, Cameras, Intelligent transportation systems, Roadside flora, Toll collection, Traffic surveillance, Vandalism, Visual obstructions","Data and Information Technology, Highways, Operations and Traffic Management, I72: Traffic and Transport Planning",5/15/2015 12:12:00 PM,5/28/2015 9:23:00 AM,Web,pp 957-962,,"Raghavan, A","Price, R","Liu, J",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,References,2012-09-00,,15th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC2012),,,,,,,,,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE),Find a library where document is available,,,,,,,,,9781467330640,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

That is, the threat of an undesirable sanction encourages drivers to comply with traffic laws.  However, not all traffic law violations are considered equal.  For example, while drink driving is generally seen as socially unacceptable, behaviours such as speeding are arguably less so, and speed enforcement is often portrayed in the popular media as a means of &ldquo;revenue raising&rdquo;.  The perceived legitimacy of traffic law enforcement has received limited research attention to date.  Perceived legitimacy of traffic law enforcement may influence (or be influenced by) attitudes toward illegal driving behaviours, and both of these factors are likely to influence on-road driving behaviour.  This study aimed to explore attitudes toward a number of illegal driving behaviours and traffic law enforcement approaches that typically target these behaviours using self-reported data from a large sample of drivers.

The current program was expanded and applied to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in an attempt to determine if reducing speeds in neighborhoods would lead to a reduction in pedestrian-involved crashes. The study attempted to increase speed enforcement by the Philadelphia Police Department (PPD) in six police districts by purchasing 24 Speed Tracker units that were installed and calibrated in four police cars in each of the six police districts. Since Pennsylvania law prohibits the use of radar by local police, the availability of the Speed Tracker timing devices provided the PPD with additional capability to document speed violations. It was hoped that publicizing this capability would deter speeding in the test districts. The Philadelphia Streets Department focused its efforts on engineering countermeasures in the six target police districts. Street Smarts, the city’s safety education contractor, distributed pedestrian safety information throughout the city; however, community involvement in the targeted districts was limited. The evaluation of the program showed speed reductions at 17 of 24 measurement locations. However, no crash reductions were observed in the six districts relative to the remainder of the city. Also, an awareness survey showed little penetration of the safety messages or awareness of increased speeding enforcement by the police. This is not surprising given the lack of paid media, the sparse enforcement that was actually mounted in the test districts, and the assessment of awareness at licensing centers outside the test districts. Overall, the results indicate that a direct scale-up of Heed the Speed as used in targeted Arizona neighborhoods to a city the size of Philadelphia is likely not realistic given the resources required. The study also suggested that the inability to use radar as an enforcement tool was not totally overcome by the use of quantitative speed timing devices. Either the techniques should remain as originally developed and only be applied on a road-segment-by-road-segment basis, or the Heed the Speed toolkit should be expanded to address the unique situations and constraints of large, congested cities where speeding is not an enforcement priority.",,"HSL, NTL, TRIS, ATRI, USDOT",DOT HS 811 515,,,,,,,,,,DTNH22-05-C-05088,,,,,,,,,,"Countermeasures, Crash rates, Equipment, Pedestrian safety, Philadelphia (Pennsylvania), Public information programs, Residential streets, Speed control, Speed measurement, Speeding, Surveys, Traffic citations, Traffic law enforcement, Traffic safety education","Highways, Operations and Traffic Management, Pedestrians and Bicyclists, Safety and Human Factors, I73: Traffic Control, I83: Accidents and the Human Factor",9/19/2012 1:19:00 PM,10/10/2012 3:05:00 PM,Digital/other,94p,,"Blomberg, Richard D","Thomas III, F Dennis","Marziani, Bruce J",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Appendices, Figures, Photos, References, Tables",2012-07-00,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Dunlap and Associates, Incorporated",National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,National Technical Information Service,,,,,,,,,,,,,Final Report,9/16/05-9/15/10,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

Traditionally, this task has been partially solved using radar and/or laser technologies and, more recently, using video-camera based systems. All these systems have significant shortcomings that have yet to be overcome. The main drawback of classical Doppler radar technology is that the velocity measurement fails when several vehicles are in the radars beam. Modern radar systems are able to measure speed and range between vehicle and radar. However, this is not enough to discriminate the lane where the vehicle is driving on. The limitation of several vehicles in the beam is overcome using laser technology. However, laser systems have another important limitation: They cannot measure the speed of several vehicles simultaneously. Novel video-camera systems, based on license plate identification, solve the previous drawbacks, but they have the problem that they can only measure average speed but never top-speed. This paper studies the feasibility of using an interferometric linear frequency modulated continuous wave radar to improve top-speed enforcement on roadways. Two different systems based on down-the-road and across-the-road radar configurations are presented. The main advantage of the proposed solutions is they can simultaneously measure speed, range, and lane of several vehicles, allowing the univocal identification of the offenders. A detailed analysis about the operation and accuracy of these solutions is reported. In addition, the feasibility of the proposed techniques has been demonstrated with simulations and real experiments using a Ka-band interferometric radar developed by the authors' research group.",Abstract reprinted with permission of IEEE.,TRIS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Doppler radar, Highway traffic, Interferometry, Laser radar, Radar vehicle detectors, Traffic control, Traffic surveillance, Velocity measurement","Highways, Operations and Traffic Management, I73: Traffic Control",12/11/2014 3:33:00 PM,1/27/2015 11:22:00 AM,Digital/other,pp 959-970,,"Felguera-Martín, David","González-Partida, José-Tomás","Almorox-González, Pablo","Burgos-García, Mateo",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Figures, Photos, References, Tables",2012-03-00,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Find a library where document is available,,,,,,,,,,,61,3,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

The development of effective countermeasures designed to reduce the prevalence of speeding behaviour requires that this behaviour is well understood.  The primary aim of this program of research was to develop a better understanding of the influence of drivers&rsquo; perceptions and attitudes toward police speed enforcement on speeding behaviour.  Study 1 employed focus group discussions with 39 licensed drivers to explore the influence of perceptions relating to specific characteristics of speed enforcement policies and practices on drivers&rsquo; attitudes towards speed enforcement.  Three primary factors were identified as being most influential: site selection; visibility; and automaticity (i.e., whether the enforcement approach is automated/camera-based or manually operated).  Perceptions regarding these enforcement characteristics were found to influence attitudes regarding the perceived legitimacy and transparency of speed enforcement.  Moreover, misperceptions regarding speed enforcement policies and practices appeared to also have a substantial impact on attitudes toward speed enforcement, typically in a negative direction.

1263826,01494743,Impact on Vehicle Speeds and Pollutant Emissions of a Fully 3 Automated Section Speed Control Scheme on the Naples Urban 4 motorway,,DO,English,,,,,,,,"Section speed enforcement systems are becoming established as cost-effective measures to reduce the incidence of speeding and thus improve road safety. It is also widely acknowledged that speed levels affect pollutant emissions. Therefore, significant co-benefits in environment and road safety are expected from the application of such systems. Yet few studies have investigated the environmental effects of speed limit reduction and even fewer those of tight speed limit enforcement. In this study an empirical analysis is carried out to investigate the impact of a new 80km/h speed limit and tight enforcement on an urban motorway in Italy. First a detailed analysis of individual-vehicle section speeds (i.e. section travel times) is performed. The study focuses on seven motorway sections and three reference periods, namely weekday peak hours, free-flow hours and the entire week. This allows the effect of road geometry and traffic conditions to be evaluated as well. Secondly, thorough calculation of pollutant emissions and fuel consumption is carried out. As it is based on individual vehicle speeds, the effect of changes in speed variance among drivers is also captured. This turned out to be relevant to the application. Basically, study outcomes suggest that the strategy can be a straightforward and effective policy to put eco-driving principles into practice, only in network stretches or in time periods in which congestion is not too heavy. Therefore, for such systems the opportunity for significant co-benefits in fuel economy and road safety appears to exist only under these strict conditions.",Abstract reprinted with permission from Intelligent Transportation Society of America.,TRIS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ecodriving, Environmental impacts, Exhaust gases, Intelligent transportation systems, Naples (Italy), Pollutants, Traffic congestion, Traffic speed, Travel time","Environment, Highways, Operations and Traffic Management, I15: Environment, I73: Traffic Control",9/27/2013 3:02:00 PM,3/2/2015 10:14:00 AM,Digital/other,27p,,"Punzo, Vincenzo","Cascetta, Ennio","Bonnel, Pierre",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"CD-ROM, Figures, Photos, References, Tables",2012-00-00,,19th ITS World Congress,ERTICO - ITS Europe,European Commission,ITS America,ITS Asia-Pacific,,,,,,,ITS America,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ITS America,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

Researchers at IIHS concluded that cities using RLCs had a significantly larger percentage reduction in both red light running (RLR) fatality rates and total fatality rates at signalized intersections. Because a previous IIHS study on RLCs was found to use flawed research methods, as well as to incorrectly report findings, the current IIHS RLC analysis is reviewed for adherence to scientific methods. This review reveals that the 2011 IIHS study is logically flawed and violates basic scientific research methods required for a study’s findings to be valid. It has neither internal nor external validity. More importantly, the IIHS did not fully explain the results of its analysis. Correctly interpreting its model’s results actually shows that cities using RLCs had an estimated higher rate of red light running fatalities, specifically 25%, than cities that did not use RLCs in the period “after” cameras were used. Further, the IIHS study was only able to make statements suggesting favorable results from the use of RLCs due to the biased selection of sampled cities. The red light running fatality rate as well as the total fatality rate at all signalized intersections in cities that used cameras was higher in both the “before” and “after” time periods, which affirms that superior interventions exist.

Traffic Signals Turn Red to Stop Speeding Drivers,,DO,English,,,http://www.itsinternational.com/categories/enforcement/features/traffic-signals-turn-red-to-stop-speeding-drivers/?locale=en,,,,,"This article describes how the United Kingdom (UK) is the latest European country to introduce ‘soft’ speed enforcement techniques that use existing traffic signal arrays to detect that an approaching vehicle is exceeding the speed limit and stop it in its tracks. The aim of these signals is to deter violations by offering drivers an incentive to behave rather than relying on the fear of a penalty. The article discusses the pilots that are currently under way in London and Swindon (an area in south-west England). Such systems already have a pedigree on the Euro mainland. In Spain, electronic traffic control technology specialists have been deploying them for the last 10 years, largely at the approaches to schools and in smaller towns. The aim of these signals is to reduce the risk of accidents to vulnerable road users when vehicles are arriving at high speeds where pedestrians are attempting to cross the street. Calibrated for use at speeds of up to 126km/h the technology is designed to integrate with adaptive multi-algorithmic optimization techniques (ADIMOT) of urban traffic control products. When a vehicle reaches a loop detector, the system knows how long it should take, driving at or below the legal speed limit, to reach a predetermined point ahead of an upcoming traffic signal. Once the vehicle exceeds the limit, the alerted signal flashes an intermittent amber signal for a fixed minimum period (six seconds). If there are no following vehicles, the signal flashes three seconds of fixed amber and then returns to red, its resting state. In The Netherlands, Peek Traffic is deploying a soft enforcement scheme at two intersections in the eastern city of Enschede. The adapted traffic signals are normally on standby red. When a vehicle approaches, the controller switches the signal to green unless it has detected speeding; in which case, it maintains the red period to slow the vehicle down. The system is switched off outside rush hours.",,TRIS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Automatic speed control, London (England), Loop detectors, Netherlands, Speed limits, Traffic signal controllers, Traffic signal phases, Traffic signals","Highways, Operations and Traffic Management, I73: Traffic Control",4/17/2012 10:18:00 AM,4/19/2012 11:24:00 AM,Print,pp 37-38,,"Crawford, David",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Figures, Photos",2012-00-00,ITS International,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Find a library where document is available,,,,,,,,,,,18,1,,January/February,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

The base data were collected when signage typical of that shown in the ""Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices"" for an Interstate highway work zone with no lane reduction was present. Police and SPE data were collected, respectively, when a police patrol car and an SPE van were added to the typical work zone. From each data set, the step-by-step progression from a three-regime model based on least-squares regression to a four-regime speed–flow curve is presented. The four-regime model comprises four equations: (a) horizontal line for free-flow regime that covered the volume levels up to 900 passenger cars per hour per lane, (b) fourth-degree spline for the upper transition part of the speed–flow curve, (c) another fourth-degree spline for the lower transitions part, and (d) equation in the form of power function for the highly congested part of the speed–flow relationship. The speed–flow curve for the base case had a free-flow speed (FFS) of 61.3 mph and a capacity of 1,850 per car per hour per lane (pcphpl).

Recent developments in the area of automated speed enforcement in Australia help to illustrate the important link between community attitudes to speed enforcement and subsequent speed camera policy developments. A perceived lack of community confidence in camera programs prompted reviews in New South Wales and Victoria in 2011 by the jurisdictional Auditor-General. This paper explores automated speed camera enforcement in Australia with particular reference to the findings of these two reports as they relate to the level of public support for, and community attitudes towards, automated speed enforcement.

Speed limit violations are prevalent, even on motorways with speed cameras. A problem with speed camera enforcement is that some motorists brake before passing a camera location and then exceed the speed limit after passing. This sudden braking can cause dangerous situations, crashes, and traffic jams. Furthermore, safe operating speed is not achieved where there are no cameras, especially where enforcement is overt, as in Italy. A new technique to overcome these problems is an automated section speed enforcement system, Safety Tutor. Unlike conventional speed meters, which measure vehicle speed at one point, the new technique determines average speed over a long distance. This study evaluated the safety effectiveness of the Safety Tutor system installed on Italian Motorway A1 Milan–Naples in 2007. An empirical Bayes observational before-and-after study was performed. The estimate of the total crash reduction is 31.2%, with a lower 95% confidence limit of 24.3%. The greatest crash reductions were observed for severe crashes and crashes at curves. Reduction was 55.6% for severe crashes, 26.6% for nonsevere crashes, 43.4% at curves, and 28.4% at tangents. However, the system’s effectiveness decreased over time. The crash reduction was 39.4% in the first semester after the system’s activation and 18.7% in the fifth semester after activation. Results strongly support activation of the new automated system owing to highly significant and substantial safety effects. The decrease in system effectiveness over time may be correctible with higher levels of enforcement.",,"TRIS, TRB, ATRI",12-0226,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Automated enforcement, Automated speed enforcement, Cameras, Crash severity, Highway safety, Italy, Safety Performance Functions, Speed cameras, Speed control, Speed detectors","Highways, Operations and Traffic Management, Safety and Human Factors, I73: Traffic Control, I85: Safety Devices used in Transport Infrastructure",2/8/2012 4:53:00 PM,10/29/2012 9:56:00 AM,Print,pp 16–25,,"Montella, Alfonso","Persaud, Bhagwant","D'Apuzzo, Mauro","Imbriani, Lella Liana",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Figures, References, Tables",2012-00-00,Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Transportation Research Board Business Office,Find a library where document is available,,,,,,,,,9780309223201,,2281,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

1128604,01366456,Analysis of Drivers’ Compliance to Speed Limits Enforced with an Automated Section Speed Enforcement System,,DO,English,,,,,,,Transportation Research Board Annual Meeting 2012 Paper #12-0228,"This study evaluated the effectiveness of speed limits enforced with an automated section speed enforcement system (ASSES) through the analysis of compliance after the system implementation in the Italian Motorway A3 Naples-Salerno. The speed limits were selected taking into account take both the safety and the mobility needs. The system was activated on April 21, 2010 and the driving speeds were monitored in the two periods April 21, 2010 - May 11, 2010 and March 30, 2011 - April 20, 2011. Non compliance to the speed limits was higher for the heavy vehicles (w>3.5 tons) than for the light vehicles (w≤3.5 tons). This is very challenging because of the high severity of the crashes involving trucks, which is further increased by the higher speed. Non compliance of the light vehicles was much higher in the sections with the most constrained alignments (sections with speed limit 80 kph vs. sections with speed limit 100 kph, 65% vs. 40%). An explanation of this behaviour is that drivers do not adequately compensate for more demanding driving conditions by reducing speed if the safe speed is much lower than the speed desired in relation to the highway type and function. Overall, non compliance to the speed limits was 50.5% in 2010 and 57.4% in 2011. The decrease in the drivers’ compliance over time suggests that a weak enforcement strategy was applied. Higher compliance to the speed limits, according to the authors’ belief, might be achieved by a better strategy of communication and information to the road users and a speed limit management strategy synergic between the highway agency and the Police who actually manages the commitments of fines.",This paper was sponsored by TRB committee AHB20 Freeway Operations,"TRIS, TRB",12-0228,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Heavy duty vehicles, Light vehicles, Speed limits, Speeding, Traffic law enforcement, Trucks","Highways, Operations and Traffic Management, Safety and Human Factors, I73: Traffic Control, I83: Accidents and the Human Factor",2/8/2012 4:53:00 PM,3/29/2012 7:14:00 AM,Digital/other,19p,,"Montella, Alfonso","Punzo, Vincenzo","Montanino, Marcello",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Figures, References, Tables",2012-00-00,,Transportation Research Board 91st Annual Meeting,Transportation Research Board,,,,,,,,,,Transportation Research Board,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

When appropriately complemented with police enforcement, SFS can be an effective method for reducing speeds at a desired location. However, as reported in the literature, effectiveness of SFS is limited not only in regard to time after the deployment but also for distance. Therefore, a need exists to understand how far upstream and downstream of the SFS speed reductions are maintained. Through a unique data collection methodology, researchers obtained trajectories of free-flowing vehicles that approached an SFS, as well as trajectories of vehicles receding from the SFS. Trajectory data were used by researchers to determine the locations at which drivers willing to reduce their speed when approaching the SFS actually started the reduction. Downstream of the SFS, the distance at which drivers started increasing their speed after complying with the sign was also determined. Results showed the feasibility of determining the spatial effectiveness of SFS. By using the methods as presented, speed enforcement personnel can understand how drivers in an area of interest react to SFS and therefore can determine the best locations for SFS as well as the number of SFS that need to be deployed to achieve a speed reduction over a segment of road.",,"TRIS, TRB, ATRI",12-0743,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Highway safety, Speed control, Speed display signs, Speed profiles, Speed signs, Traffic control devices","Highways, Operations and Traffic Management, Safety and Human Factors, I73: Traffic Control, I85: Safety Devices used in Transport Infrastructure",2/8/2012 4:57:00 PM,10/29/2012 9:44:00 AM,Print,pp 8–15,,"Santiago-Chaparro, Kelvin R","Chitturi, Madhav","Bill, Andrea","Noyce, David A",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Figures, Photos, References",2012-00-00,Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Transportation Research Board Business Office,Find a library where document is available,,,,,,,,,9780309223201,,2281,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

Lessening the incidence of exceeding the speed limit is one way that can effectively reduce these rates.  Speed enforcement technology has now progressed to the current state of point-to-point speed cameras.  P2P cameras operate by photographing all vehicles passing both the start and end of a section of road under consideration.  The photographs are time stamped which allows travel time to be derived.  Computer software identifies the number plates of passing vehicles and matches the images taken.  The cameras are a known distance apart and hence the average speed can be calculated.

In 2004, Illinois passed the Automated Traffic Control Systems in Highway Construction or Maintenance Zones Act, authorizing speed-radar photo enforcement (SPE) in work zones on highways.  The objective was to improve speed limit compliance and work zone safety.  SPE significantly reduced the speeds of cars and trucks by 3 to 8 mph in work zones.

Currently an error source of this measurement approach is being discussed. It is expected to occur when motorcycles which are deployed for measurements are in an inclined position. So far there is no empirically proven and quantitative information available on the influence of the inclined position of the measurement vehicles on the precision of the measurements. Therefore, the engineering office Peuser Foerch Ingenieure in Neckarsulm conducted a survey to clarify this issue.

The current study takes advantage of a natural experiment in which a rural town with a strict speed enforcement policy was labeled a “speed trap” through the introduction of a billboard advertisement funded by the American Automobile Association. Drawing on theories of police legitimacy, we hypothesize the label will result in an abrupt-permanent increase in speeding citation contestation rates, despite the fact that the billboard actually increases predictability of citation issuance. Results of an interrupted time-series analysis indicate statistically significant abrupt-permanent increases in the speeding citation contestation rates for the intervention city. Further analyses reveal that significant intervention effects are confined to drivers with higher opportunity to contest tickets (in-state drivers) and to majority subgroups (Whites and men).

The function describes the percentage effect of enforcement on the number of injury accidents as a function of the relative change in the amount of enforcement. Thirteen studies that have evaluated the effects of different levels of enforcement, each containing between four and eight data points, were used as data source. A hypothesis regarding the shape of an accident modification function was formulated to help assess the plausibility of the estimated relationships. In the first stage of analysis, functions were fitted to the data points of each study by means of weighted regression analysis. Many of these functions were highly implausible and likely to be influenced by outlying data points and random variation. In the second stage of analysis, data from all studies except two were pooled and data points referring to identical or almost identical levels of enforcement were aggregated to reduce the influence of random variation. The number of data points was thus reduced from 63 to 15 and an accident modification function was fitted to the data points.

This article reports on a study that investigated the headway distribution of platooning vehicles in work zones with and without automated Speed Photo Enforcement (SPE).  The authors collected and analyzed data from two work zones; they also examined the portion of vehicles traveling with a very short headway (less than 0.7 sec). In addition, the behavior of vehicles near the law enforcement vehicles was analyzed in terms of applying brakes and changing lanes in one of the work zones.  The authors found that the mean headway of cars in the median lane significantly increased in both work zones when the SPE van was present compared to the base condition. For trucks, the mean headway increase was significant only in the shoulder lane when the SPE was present. This is a beneficial effect and indicates that drivers had a longer time to react to the lead vehicles. The proportion of cars traveling with a very short headway in the median lane significantly decreased when a SPE van was present at one work zone (I-64).  The authors also found that the difference in braking behavior was not significant when SPE was compared to police car presence; however, lane-changing behavior was significant.

The level of random breath testing (RBT) in South Australia in 2009 increased to the highest level of the five year period.  The proportion of tests conducted using mobile RBT remained stable.  The detection rate, based on evidentiary testing, decreased slightly in 2009 and was lower than in most other Australian jurisdictions.  The level of drug testing increased by 70 per cent in 2009.  Testing rates per head of population continued to be the highest in Australia.  The drug detection rate rose slightly in 2009, as did the level of drug driving among fatally injured drivers.  THC (the active component of cannabis) was the most commonly detected drug.  The number of hours spent on speed enforcement decreased in 2009.  The number of speeding detections decreased for all types of detection devices.  Detections per thousand vehicles passing a speed camera decreased, most likely due to driver adaptation to the lowering of the speed limit tolerance in late 2007.  Systematic speed surveys found no change in mean travelling speeds but the percentage of vehicles speeding by more than 5 km/h reduced on Adelaide arterial roads.  Restraint offences increased by 10 per cent in 2009.  Restraint use in serious and fatal crashes remained lower in rural regions than in the metropolitan area.  Males were more likely to be charged with a restraint offence and less likely to be wearing a restraint in a fatal or serious injury crash.

A comprehensive before-and-after analysis of the impact of the SEP on safety revealed significant reductions in crash frequency and severity, which indicates that the SEP is a promising countermeasure for improving safety. However, there is often a tradeoff between safety and mobility when safety investments are considered. As a result, identifying safety countermeasures that both improve safety and reduce Travel Time Variability (TTV) is a desirable goal for traffic safety engineers. This paper reports on the analysis of the mobility impacts of the SEP by simulating the traffic network with and without the SEP, calibrated to real world conditions. The simulation results show that the SEP decreased the TTV: the risk of unreliable travel was at least 23% higher in the ‘without SEP’ scenario than in the ‘with SEP’ scenario. In addition, the total Travel Time Savings (TTS) from the SEP was estimated to be at least ‘569 vehicle-hours/year.’ Consequently, the SEP is an efficient countermeasure not only for reducing crashes but also for improving mobility through TTS and reduced TTV.",© Korean Society of Civil Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011.,TRIS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Automated enforcement, Before and after studies, Cameras, Crash rates, Microscopic traffic flow, Scottsdale (Arizona), State Highway 101, Traffic safety, Traffic simulation, Travel time","Data and Information Technology, Highways, Operations and Traffic Management, Safety and Human Factors",5/17/2019 3:18:00 PM,6/27/2019 2:54:00 PM,Digital/other,pp 167-174,,"Shin, Kangwon","Washington, Simon P","Choi, Keechoo",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"References, Tables",2011-01-00,KSCE Journal of Civil Engineering,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Find a library where document is available,,,,,,,,,,,15,1,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

Likewise, many past studies investigated the effects of intelligent transportation system (ITS) implementation on vehicle speeds in freeway work zones. However, the effects of police enforcement and ITS implementation on work zone traffic flow characteristics and capacity have not yet been extensively studied. Hence, this study investigates the distinct effects of police enforcement and ITS implementation on work zone speed-flow curve and capacity. Three sets of traffic data were collected in a two-lane-open work zone located on I-55 near Chicago. The first data set was collected when there was only the traditional Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) signage in the work zone. The second and the third data sets were collected when there was additionally police enforcement and Speed Photo Enforcement (SPE) in the work zone, respectively. The results showed that both the police enforcement and SPE led to significant changes in the work zone speed-flow curve compared to only MUTCD signage conditions. The general shape of the speed-flow relationship inside the work zone was similar to the speed-flow curve under basic freeway conditions, but the bending point of the upper branch of the curve occurred at lower traffic flow rates and the rate of the decrease in speed was higher. The speed-flow curve for the MUTCD signage-only case returned a work zone capacity of around 1,850 passenger cars per hour per lane (pcphpl). Compared to that speed-flow curve, both the police enforcement and SPE moved the upper (uncongested) branch of the speed-flow curve downward, which caused a work zone capacity reduction of about 50 pcphpl in the case of police enforcement and 100 pcphpl in the case of SPE implementation. The results obtained through this study reveals the distinct effects of police enforcement and ITS on work zone capacity. Accurately estimating the capacity of work zones with different speed reduction treatments provides more efficient operation in a real-time system, more accurate diversion and traveler information for alternate routing, improved reliability of the system, and better understanding of the traffic flow characteristics in work zones.",Abstract reprinted with permission from Elsevier.,TRIS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Intelligent transportation systems, Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, Police, Speed camera ticketing, Traffic data, Traffic flow, Work zone traffic control","Highways, Operations and Traffic Management, I73: Traffic Control",4/12/2012 12:38:00 PM,4/13/2012 10:08:00 AM,Digital/other,pp 430-439,,"Avrenli, Kivanc A","Benekohal, Rahim F","Ramezani, Hani",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Figures, References, Tables",2011-00-00,Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences,6th International Symposium on Highway Capacity and Quality of Service,Transportation Research Board,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Find a library where document is available,,,,,,,,,,,16,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

There are a number of infrastructural measures that can be implemented to improve drivers’ behavior and support enforcement of road traffic law. The objective of these measures are to prevent most violations from occurring, influencing unintentional behavior or at least preventing errors and unintentional violations, leaving the police and enforcement agencies to better target resources towards drivers who still and/or severely violate the rules. Infrastructure can support drivers by providing cues that are meant to affect both conscious and unconscious behavior. By providing continuous feedback about location-specific rules, drivers are provided with instantaneous and explicit knowledge of what rules are in place, for instance when they have missed the posted speed limit. A logical fit of road layout and location-specific rules provides support for better and more natural or intuitive compliance. This fit can also support the predictability of rules and the behavior of other road users on a road, Recognizable Roads, and so the implicit expectations of drivers. Research has shown that supporting expectations of drivers decreases the probability that they miss important information and make errors that can result in a crash. This idea of implicit and explicit information by road design and layout is linked to the concept of Self-Explaining Roads (SER).

In addition, when the headway between two vehicles is less than the follower's reaction time, a rear end collision is likely to happen if the leader suddenly decreases its speed. In this paper, the effects of the SPE on the headway of vehicles traveling along a work zone are studied. For this purpose, we collected data from two locations that were around 1.5 miles apart in a work zone on interstate highway 55 at. The SPE van was present at the upstream location. The headway of all vehicles within a period of 45 minutes was measured at the upstream location as well as the downstream location. The results of this study showed that the presence of the SPE did not reduce the headway of the traffic stream at the location that it was present, as well as at the downstream location. This was confirmed by comparing the headway of followers (headway less than four seconds) when the SPE was deployed in the work zone to the headway of them when the SPE was not present, for both lanes combined, and for the shoulder and median lanes separately. The same result was observed for different pairs of leaders and followers.

Results of the speed control system have been assessed by speed monitoring after the system implementation in the Italian Motorway A3 Naples-Salerno.  The speed limits were selected taking into account the average of the following values: (1) minimum design speed; (2) minimum speed consistent with the available stopping sight distance; and (3) operating speeds before the ASSES implementation. The first two criteria take into account safety whereas the third criterion takes into account the mobility needs. The speed limits selected with these criteria were then refined basing on: maximum difference between the section speed limit and the minimum speed evaluated with criteria 1 and 2, evaluation of critical conditions, and consistency between the speed limits and the highway function. 	Overall, non compliance to the speed limits was equal to 50%. Non compliance was higher for heavy vehicles (60-70%) than for light vehicles (32-65%). Non compliance of light vehicles was much higher in the sections with the most constrained alignments (64% in sections with speed limit equal to 80 kph vs. 34% in sections with speed limit equal to 100 kph).

However, the fact that speed limits are very often violated on a large scale in Thailand suggests the need for implementing more effective speed management strategies such as automatic speed camera, increasing speeding penalty, and smart vehicle design to control vehicle speeds. While the effectiveness of such measures depends mainly on how well they could lead drivers to change speeding behavior, public acceptability is also vital as a key to sustainability of most speed management programs. This paper attempts to identify public acceptability of speed management measures, both currently implemented and under consideration, in the context of Thailand. In doing so, data from the questionnaire surveys based on a random sample of 2180 drivers in Thailand including a wide range of individual characteristics of respondents and their attitudes to select speed management schemes are analyzed using an econometric technique. In particular, we introduce a simplified methodological framework to develop a better understanding of factors that explain drivers’ attitudes towards speeding behavior and alternative speed management strategies.

The study specifically sought answers to the following two questions: (a) How did drivers respond to ASE on rural highways where live speed enforcement is limited? (b) What was the spatial extent of the speed reduction effects of ASE on rural highways? The research team compared speed data collected at various distances from seven sites in the Nanjing area of China where speed cameras were deployed. It was found that ASE significantly reduced vehicle speeds and speed violations in the vicinity of the locations where the speed cameras were deployed. However, ASE was not an effective way to reduce vehicle speeds on road sections beyond the area of influence of the speed cameras. The speed profiles developed in this study showed that the area of influence of a speed camera on a rural highway was generally less than 1 km. Drivers usually started to decelerate about 300 to 400 m before the speed cameras and recovered their original speeds about 300 to 400 m after the speed cameras. The findings suggested that without supplementation with other live speed enforcement efforts, such as mobile or stationary police patrols, elimination of speed violations on rural highways by the use of ASE alone would be difficult. A more realistic solution would be to deploy speed cameras at preselected potentially hazardous locations, such as intersections and horizontal curves, to help reduce speed violations.",,"TRIS, TRB",11-1341,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Automated enforcement, Behavior, Cameras, Drivers, Nanjing (China), Rural highways, Speed control, Speed reduction (Motor vehicles), Speeding, Traffic law enforcement","Highways, Operations and Traffic Management, Safety and Human Factors, I73: Traffic Control, I83: Accidents and the Human Factor",2/17/2011 5:46:00 PM,3/15/2012 12:35:00 PM,Print,pp 109-117,,"Liu, Pan","Zhang, Xu","Wang, Wei","Xu, Chengcheng",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Figures, Photos, References, Tables",2011-00-00,Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Transportation Research Board Business Office,Find a library where document is available,,,,,,,,,9780309223027,,2265,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

However, to date, only a scattering of ITS applications have been seriously examined for privacy issues.  These include photo enforcement, electronic tolling, incident management, vehicle-mile taxing, weigh-in-motion, and vehicle-infrastructure integration systems or IntelliDrive. In a recent national survey to determine how state departments of transportation (DOTs) are meeting the privacy needs of the traveling public, it was determined that DOTs favor following available privacy legislation to ensure privacy.  Unfortunately, there are no national standards for the privacy protection of travelers as most privacy information merely takes the form of poorly defined precepts. With the increasing use of ITS applications, which are becoming much more interwoven into the US transportation grid, there is a need to develop national standards to ensure the privacy protection of the traveling public.

The results indicated that the SPE system and police–trailer treatments reduced the mean speed of both the general traffic stream and free-flowing vehicles by about 5 to 7 mph. The magnitudes of the speed reductions while the treatments were deployed were sustained over time. Police presence alone also reduced the speed significantly but to a lesser degree, and the effects of the trailer treatment alone were limited. The frequency and the degree of speeding were also influenced by the treatments to various degrees. The proportion of drivers speeding by more than 10 mph was reduced by 8.7% by the SPE system treatment and by 8.9% by the police–trailer and police treatments, which brought the rate of speeding down to 0.2% for the SPE system treatment and 0% for the police–trailer and police treatments. These treatments also reduced the frequency of speeding by 10 mph or less by 36% to 46%.

The automated section speed enforcement system is increasingly being used as an effective way to tackle speeding, especially on motorways and in tunnels.

An empirical analysis of traffic flow patterns before and after the introduction of such a system along a freeway section with recurrent congestion is presented. Gathered data consisted of point measurements at detectors and average travel speeds of each vehicle crossing the stretch. The main observed features were (a) a strong homogenization of individual speeds and of mean speeds among the lanes, (b) a reduction in the strength of the bottleneck, (c) the emergence of significant oscillations in time of traffic characteristics, and (d) a sensible reduction of travel times during the congestion pattern caused by the bottleneck moving downstream of the section.

During this project, NCHRP Report 622 was published. It categorized 23 behavioral highway safety countermeasures as proven with high-quality research. A review of the research and NCHRP Report 622 showed that a RSPII was feasible. A six-step RSPII framework was developed, and six LSIMs were selected for further consideration: primary enforcement of seat belt use, universal motorcycle helmet use, regular application of sobriety checkpoints, graduated driver licensing program upgrades, mandatory ignition interlock installation, and automated speed enforcement. A state-by-state estimate (based on current research) of how enactment and proper implementation and enforcement of these LSIMs could reduce crash fatalities on rural roadways was completed. The national fatality reductions estimated for each LSIM ranged from 120 to 699.

A total of five datasets were analyzed. For the two data sets that compared the before versus during analysis periods, the enforcement period displayed a general reduction in aggressive motorists while creating a more stable spatial speeding distribution through the work zone. Two of the three data sets comparing the during versus after enforcement periods showed that motorists may learn where enforcement is taking place and adjust their speeds accordingly.

Conversely, motorcycle performance capability may influence the likelihood of risky driving behaviors such as speeding. Both mechanisms may affect fatal crash risk when examined by motorcycle type. Although it was not possible to estimate the effect of each mechanism, the current study analyzed fatal crash data for evidence of motorcycle type differences in risky driving behaviors and risk of driver death. Street legal motorcycles were classified into 10 types based on design characteristics and then further grouped as cruiser/standard, touring, sport touring, sport/unclad sport, supersport, and all others. For each motorcycle type, driver death rates per 10,000 registered vehicle years and the prevalence of fatal crash characteristics such as speeding were analyzed. Differences among motorcycle types concerning the effect of engine displacement were examined using Poisson regression. Overall, driver death rates for supersport motorcycles were four times as high as those for cruiser/standard motorcycles. Fatally injured supersport drivers were most likely to have been speeding and most likely to have worn helmets, but least likely to have been impaired by alcohol compared with drivers of other motorcycle types. The patterns in driver factors held after accounting for the effects of age and gender. Increased engine displacement was associated with higher driver death rates for each motorcycle type. Strong effects of motorcycle type were observed on driver death rates and on the likelihood of risky driving behaviors such as speeding and alcohol impairment. Although the current study could not completely disentangle the effects of motorcycle type and rider characteristics such as age on driver death rates, the effects of both motorcycle type and rider age on the likelihood of risky driving behaviors were observed among fatally injured motorcycle drivers. Certain motorcycle designs, particularly supersport motorcycles, are associated with increases in risky driving behaviors and higher driver death rates. At present, there are no proven countermeasures for this situation. However, existing countermeasures such as helmet laws and automated speed enforcement could have a substantial benefit.

As part of a larger study evaluating the effects of penalty increases in 2003 on speeding offenders in Queensland, the research team considered four definitions of recidivism across two cohorts of drivers detected for speeding prior to (2001) and after (2003) the speeding penalty changes: 1. the proportion of offenders who re-offended in the follow up period; 2. the overall frequency of re-offending in the follow up period; 3. the length of delay to re-offence among those who re-offended; and 4. the average number of re-offences during the follow up period among those who re-offended.  Overall, results suggested evidence of an absolute deterrent effect of penalty changes in that there were significant reductions in the proportion of drivers who re-offended and the overall frequency of re-offending, consistent with prediction.  However, there was no evidence of a marginal specific deterrent effect among those who re-offended.  Contrary to prediction, there was a significant reduction in the length of time to re-offence and no significant change in average number of offences committed.  Speed camera and radar data were analysed to explore whether the changes in re-offence patterns may have been influenced by changes in speed enforcement activity.  This analysis indicated that the speed enforcement operational hours increased by 43 per cent from the pre to post-penalty change period, suggesting that the reduction in offences observed in the follow-up period was not due to an enforcement effect.",,"ITRD, ARRB, ATRI",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Behavior, Cohort analysis, Conferences, Deterrence, Drivers, Penalty, Queensland, Recidivists, Speed, Speed control, Speeding","Data and Information Technology, Safety and Human Factors, Security and Emergencies, I82: Accidents and Transport Infrastructure, I83: Accidents and the Human Factor",3/15/2011 11:24:00 AM,12/29/2011 11:42:00 AM,,10p,,"WATSON, B","Siskind, V","Fleiter, J","WATSON, A",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2010-09-00,,"Australasian Road Safety Research Policing Education Conference, 2010",ARRB,,,,,,,,,,ARRB,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

Unobtrusive vehicles speeds were also measured with the aid of a radar speed gun. The speed humps are effective in reducing casualty crash frequencies by 37.5%, fatal crashes by 46% and pedestrian crashes by 72%. Generally, road traffic crashes reduced both in number and severity at the treated sites. On average, there has been an annual pedestrian crash reduction of 3.25 fatal crashes, 2.75 serious injury crashes and 0.25 minor injury crashes; resulting in an annual reduction in pedestrian casualties of 63%. The average vehicle speeds established to be between 71 km/h and 87 km/h before installation of the speed humps reduced considerably to an average of between 32 km/h and 36 km/h after installation. Speed humps are effective in reducing pedestrian crashes in settlements located along the interurban highway.

It was estimated (based on the selection of one framework outcome for each LSIM) that rural roadway crash fatalities could be reduced by 209 from the primary enforcement of seat belt use, 299 from universal motorcycle helmet use, 322 from the regular application of sobriety checkpoints, 120 from graduated driver licensing program upgrades, 268 from the mandatory ignition interlock installation, and 699 from automated speed enforcement. These estimates cannot be summed, however, because the fatalities impacted by these LSIMs sometimes overlap. The assumptions and generalizations required to overcome challenges to the RSPII framework application will also have an impact on its results.

The intent is to increase the reflectivity of the license plates, thereby overexposing the photograph and making the plate image unreadable.   These products are illegal  in California.  The field tests evaluated three products:  a brand-name photo spray, a generic lacquer spray and a license plate shield.  Results showed that the countermeasures occasionally (but not often) have a minor effect on plate legibility, but that this effect is usually not enough to make a license plate image unreadable.  The license plate shield often increased readability.  The cameras were activated 160 times, with each activation capturing a front and rear plate image.

It is also widely acknowledged that speed levels affect pollutant emissions. Therefore, significant co-benefits in environment and road safety are expected from the application of such systems. Yet few studies have investigated the environmental effects of speed limit reduction and even fewer those of tight speed limit enforcement. In this study an empirical analysis is carried out to investigate the impact of a new 80km/h speed limit and tight enforcement on an urban motorway in Italy. First a detailed analysis of individual-vehicle section speeds (i.e. section travel times) is performed. The study focuses on seven motorway sections and three reference periods, namely weekday peak hours, free-flow hours and the entire week. This allows the effect of road geometry and traffic conditions to be evaluated as well. Secondly, thorough calculation of pollutant emissions and fuel consumption is carried out. As it is based on individual vehicle speeds, the effect of changes in speed variance among drivers is also captured. This turned out to be relevant to the application. Basically, study outcomes suggest that the strategy can be a straightforward and effective policy to put eco-driving principles into practice, only in network stretches or in time periods in which congestion is not too heavy.

Both dimensions—crash frequency and crash severity—are needed to obtain a full accounting of road safety. Extensive literature and common sense both dictate that crashes are not created equal, with fatalities costing society more than 1,000 times the cost of property damage crashes on average. Despite this glaring disparity, the profession has not unanimously embraced or successfully defended a nonarbitrary severity weighting approach for analyzing safety data and conducting safety analyses. It is argued here that the two dimensions (frequency and severity) are made available by intelligently and reliably weighting crash frequencies and converting all crashes to property-damage-only crash equivalents (PDOEs) by using comprehensive societal unit crash costs. This approach is analogous to calculating axle load equivalents in the prediction of pavement damage: for instance, a 40,000-lb truck causes 4,025 times more stress than does a 4,000-lb car and so simply counting axles is not sufficient. Calculating PDOEs using unit crash costs is the most defensible and nonarbitrary weighting scheme, allows for the simple incorporation of severity and frequency, and leads to crash models that are sensitive to factors that affect crash severity. Moreover, using PDOEs diminishes the errors introduced by underreporting of less severe crashes—an added benefit of the PDOE analysis approach. The method is illustrated with rural road segment data from South Korea (which in practice would develop PDOEs with Korean crash cost data).",,"TRIS, TRB, ATRI",10-1867,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Accident costs, Case studies, Costs, Crash rates, Crash severity, Property damage, Property-damage-only crash equivalents, Rural highways, South Korea, Traffic crashes","Highways, Safety and Human Factors, I81: Accident Statistics",1/25/2010 10:52:00 AM,8/12/2010 10:24:00 AM,Print,pp 83-92,,"Oh, Jutaek","Washington, Simon","Lee, Dongmin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Maps, References, Tables",2010-00-00,Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Transportation Research Board Business Office,Find a library where document is available,,,,,,,,,9780309142793,,2148,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

The ultimate goal is to reduce the number of fatalities  and injuries on the roads. Many changes have taken place in France since 2000 and impressive results have been obtained during the last decade, with road fatalities down by 40% since 2002. Thousands of deaths and injuries have been avoided. The outstanding factor here is the implementation ofan automated speed enforcement programme (ASEP). However other important changes havealso taken place and 2000-2009 has been a decade of real evolution for speed enforcement policy in France. This contribution proposes to investigate the nature of the changes which occurred during the last decade with regard to speed enforcement: new legislation, politicalcommitment and the implementation of an ASEP.

1100509,01338101,"""AOSI"" Improving Road Safety on Rural Roads in Germany",,DO,English,,,,,,,,"Although the majority of road accidents happen in urban areas, 60% of all fatalities occur on rural roads. For this reason the Federal Highway Research Institute (BASt) established a task force to improve road safety on existing rural roads in Germany by short-term up to medium-term measures. The analysis of severe accidents on rural roads found two main contributing factors: inappropriate speed and unsafe overtaking manoeuvres. For this reason the project focussed on the enforcement of speed limits (short-term measure) and the safeguarding of overtaking manoeuvres by constructing additional passing lanes (medium-term measure). The project group chose ten roads with a high number of severe accidents. Where inappropriate speeds were a main contributing factor for accidents, speed cameras were installed. On the other roads, where unsafe overtaking manoeuvres were a main contributing factor to accident occurrence, short passing lanes were built to make overtaking safer. The research project was based on a before/after comparison of traffic and accident data. After the measures were implemented road users were questioned about their acceptance of the measures. Speed enforcement had a very positive impact on accident frequency and severity. Within 3 years accidents with serious injuries were reduced by 7 to 50 %. To this day the installation of passing lanes has been very successful, too. In a 2 years period head on crashes were reduced to zero.

Laboratory simulation techniques can achieve an overall uncertainty of measurement of better than 1 km/h and in some cases as low as 0.3 km/h. Advances in field testing techniques also allow characterising an installed systems performance. These testing techniques provide a detailed comprehensive picture of the operation, reliability, and accuracy of road safety enforcement technology and provide a valuable tool in increasing public confidence and credibility in automated speed enforcement programs.

Aggressive driving behaviors such as speeding are primary factors contributing to major-injury and fatality crashes in rural areas. Studies have also shown higher crash rates at specific highway locations such as rural work zones that temporarily set lower speed limits. To address the challenges of rural safety, the U.S. Department of Transportation kicked-off the Rural Safety Initiative in February 2008. One technological solution that has been developed to help improve the safety of rural travel through a reduction in aggressive driving is Automated Enforcement Systems (ASE). Despite the documented effectiveness, there may be legal impediments for some jurisdictions to implement ASE. To help address some of these legal impediments the California Department of Transportation in partnership with the Western Transportation Institute – Montana State University was selected by U. S. Department of Transportation to receive RSIP funds to implement, demonstrate, and validate the Augmented Speed Enforcement System (aSE).

Results indicate that visible enforcement was associated with significantly greater self-reported compliance than covert operations irrespective of the mobility of the approach, and the effects on behaviour were longer lasting.  The mobility of operations appeared to be moderated the visibility of the approach.  Specifically, increased mobility was associated with increase reported compliant behaviour, but only for covert operations, and increased longevity of reported compliant behaviour, but only for overt operations.

Section control is a method of speed enforcement involving a series of cameras installed over a stretch of road. It is also called average speed enforcement, or time-over distance cameras. The European Transport Safety Council recently published a brief review of the experience gathered from countries which have started using this technology, along with their more traditional enforcement techniques. Section control encourages drivers to reduce their speed across an entire section of road and greater levels of behaviour changes can therefore be obtained, leading to a positive impact on the numbers of collisions and casualties. This system also has air quality benefits and can be used to detect other offences, since the system captures the number plate of every vehicle entering a section equipped with the technology. It has been used successfully in the UK, Europe and Australia. In the past it has concentrated on main roads; in the future it may be used to enforce speed limits in 20mph zones.

Traffic management plans for work zones require queuing analyses to determine the anticipated traffic backups, but the predictions are often inaccurate mainly because of lack of understanding of traffic flow characteristics in WZ. The current procedures for determining speed and capacity are inadequate and don’t consider the fundamental effects of ITS technologies in traffic flow and drivers behavior. This study will address of traffic flow characteristics in Intelligent WZ and will determine methods for computing work zone capacity. Accurate determination of work zone capacity is very important because it significantly affects the speed and user's cost computations. Various ITS applications are implemented in the US (such as speed photo enforcement (SPE), dynamic lane management, variable speed control, travel time information display, dynamic rerouting, etc), but a major study to determine how traffic flow characteristics are affected in these intelligent WZ has not been conducted. This study investigated the fundamental relationship among traffic flow variables in a WZ where ITS was implemented for mainly as a speed control measure. A theoretical relationship was developed using field data collected in work zones. In order to determine the operating capacity in the intelligent work zone where SPE was deployed, the fundamental speed‐flow curve for the intelligent work zone is established and compared with the speed‐flow curve for the same work zone when neither SPE nor another type of ITS was deployed as a speed control measure. The use of ITS in the work zone altered the relationship between space mean speed and traffic flow rate by lowering the speeds in the upper (uncongested) part of the speed‐flow curve. The use of SPE also brought about a slight reduction of around 100 pcphpl in the maximum per-lane capacity of the two‐lane‐open work zone compared to when no SPE is utilized. With the speed‐flow curve for the intelligent work zone established, one can use the operating speed as an input to accurately estimate the capacity of the intelligent work zone under the prevailing conditions.","This document is disseminated under the sponsorship of the Department of Transportation, University Transportation Centers Program.","UTC, TRIS, USDOT",NEXTRANS Project No. 009IY01,,,,,,,,,,DTRT07‐G‐005 (Grant),,,,,,,,,,"Flow speed relationships, Highway capacity, Intelligent transportation systems, Speed control, Traffic flow, Work zone traffic control, Work zones","Highways, Operations and Traffic Management, I71: Traffic Theory, I73: Traffic Control",1/15/2010 2:56:00 PM,9/16/2011 12:02:00 PM,Print,60p,,"Benekohal, Rahim F","Avrenli, Kivanc","Ramezani, Hani",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Figures, References, Tables",2009-10-15,,,,,,,,,,,,,NEXTRANS,Research and Innovative Technology Administration,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NEXTRANS,,,,,,,,,,,,,Final Report,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

898884,01138888,Long-Term Speed Compliance and Safety Impacts of Rational Speed Limits,,DO,English,,,https://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)TE.1943-5436.0000017,,,,,"In 2006, speeding-related crashes accounted for over 13,500 fatalities in the United States and many studies also indicate that speed and/or speed dispersion are a major cause of crashes on U.S. highways. This paper summarizes the results of a deployment of the rational speed limits (RSLs) approach on two limited access highways in Virginia. The RSL approach involves a coordinated campaign to post sound and credible speed limits, increase speed enforcement, and implement public information and education (PI&E). The goal of the RSL approach is to better regulate travel speeds, thereby improving the safety of the traveling public. While it is common to use enforcement and PI&E in attempt to improve speed limit compliance, there is not much information on whether improvements generated by these campaigns can be sustained following the end of the formal campaign. This paper presents the results of a four-year project that examined speeds, driver attitudes, and safety before, during, and after the RSL approach was implemented. Two limited access highways where speed limits were increased from 55 to 65 mph were examined. Public perception survey results showed that the new 65 mph speed limits were well supported with over 80% agreeing with the new speed limits. The speed analysis showed that the average speed increased by a statistically significant margin immediately after the speed limit was increased, but compliance with the new posted speed limit was also significantly higher than what was observed with the old, 55 mph limit. There were practically no significant changes in speed during the increased enforcement and PI&E campaign or when speeds were examined one year after the end of the campaign. In addition, the standard deviation of speeds was fairly consistent throughout the before and after periods, which suggests that crash likelihood was not increased due to the increased posted speed limit. In fact, crash data showed that safety at the two demonstration sites was actually better than anticipated based on trends at similar comparison sites where speed limits were increased but no additional enforcement or PI&E were present. The results of the study imply that compliance and safety improvements can be sustained for at least a year after a coordinated enforcement and education campaign is completed, provided that speed limits are set appropriately.",,TRIS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Attitudes, Before and after studies, Expressways, Public information programs, Rational speed limits, Safety campaigns, Speed limits, Traffic law enforcement, Traffic safety, Traffic speed, Virginia","Highways, Operations and Traffic Management, I73: Traffic Control",8/15/2009 10:30:00 PM,8/31/2009 9:23:00 AM,Print,pp 536-544,,"Son, Hojun","Fontaine, Michael D","Park, Byungkyu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Figures, References, Tables",2009-08-00,Journal of Transportation Engineering,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Find a library where document is available,,,,,,,,,,,135,8,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

A literature review is presented in which intersection warning systems, collision detection systems, lane departure warning, vehicle-activated speed warning, point-to-point speed enforcement, fixed speed cameras, intelligent speed adaptation (ISA), weather and flooding alerts, and automatic crash notification are examined, along with systems to protect vulnerable road users and developments in variable message signs.  Workshop discussions were held across Australia and New Zealand.  Discussion points are summarised in a table, with full summaries reported in an appendix.  It was evident that there was relatively little contact between groups in the different authorities.  There was also concern that up to the present, systems had developed in isolation with little reference to emerging standards in ITS, and an urgent need to get ready for the widespread availability of ITS in new vehicles was evident.  Current developments impacting on the future of infrastructure based safety related ITS are discussed, including the allocation of dedicated radio spectrum in the 5.9 GHz range, developments in the intelligent speed assist area, and the launch of the dedicated short range communication cluster, established with the goal of facilitating the next wave of ITS developments.

In order to reduce speed-related crashes, the city of Scottsdale, Arizona implemented the first fixed-camera photo speed enforcement program (SEP) on a limited access freeway in the US. The 9-month demonstration program spanning from January 2006 to October 2006 was implemented on a 6.5 mile urban freeway segment of Arizona State Route 101 running through Scottsdale. This paper presents the results of a comprehensive analysis of the impact of the SEP on speeding behavior, crashes, and the economic impact of crashes. The impact on speeding behavior was estimated using generalized least square estimation, in which the observed speeds and the speeding frequencies during the program period were compared to those during other periods. The impact of the SEP on crashes was estimated using 3 evaluation methods: a before-and-after (BA) analysis using a comparison group, a BA analysis with traffic flow correction, and an empirical Bayes BA analysis with time-variant safety. The analysis results reveal that speeding detection frequencies (speeds >= 76 mph) increased by a factor of 10.5 after the SEP was (temporarily) terminated. Average speeds in the enforcement zone were reduced by about 9 mph when the SEP was implemented, after accounting for the influence of traffic flow. All crash types were reduced except rear-end crashes, although the estimated magnitude of impact varies across estimation methods (and their corresponding assumptions). When considering Arizona-specific crash related injury costs, the SEP is estimated to yield about $17 million in annual safety benefits.",Abstract reprinted with permission from Elsevier,"TRIS, ATRI",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Automated speed enforcement, Before and after studies, Behavior, Crashes, Demonstration projects, Economic impacts, Empirical methods, Evaluation and assessment, Highway safety, Scottsdale (Arizona), Speed cameras, Speeding","Highways, Safety and Human Factors, I80: Accident Studies",5/26/2009 1:12:00 PM,6/17/2009 12:08:00 PM,Print,pp 393-403,,"Shin, Kangwon","Washington, Simon P","van Schalkwyk, Ida",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Figures, References, Tables",2009-05-00,Accident Analysis & Prevention,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Find a library where document is available,,,,,,,,,,,41,3,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

The risk of receiving a ticket for speeding is also considered. A trip disutility concept is selected to combine the three components of speed choice (safety, time, and enforcement). The perceived crash risk and speed enforcement are considered as speed deterrents while the perceived value of a time gain is considered as a speed enticement. According to this concept, speeds that minimize the perceived trip disutility are preferred by drivers. The modeled trade-off behavior does not have to be fully rational since it is affected by drivers' preferences and their ability to perceive the risk. As such, the proposed framework follows the concept of bound rationality. The attractiveness of the model lies in its parameters being estimable with the observed preferred speeds and then interpretable as the factors of risk perception, the subjective value of time, and the perceived risk of speed enforcement. The proposed method may successfully supplement behavioral studies based on a driver survey. The study focuses on four-lane rural and suburban roads in Indiana, USA. The behavior of two types of drivers (trucks and cars) is modeled. The selection of test sites was such that the roads and other local characteristics varied across the studied sites while the population of drivers could be assumed as the same. The density of intersections, land development along the road, and the presence of sidewalks were the identified prominent risk perception factors. Another interesting finding is that the speed limit seems to encourage slow drivers to drive faster and fast drivers to drive slower.",Abstract reprinted with permission from Elsevier,"TRIS, ATRI",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Behavior, Deterrence, Drivers, Indiana, Risk assessment, Speed, Time, Traffic law enforcement, Traffic safety","Highways, Safety and Human Factors, I83: Accidents and the Human Factor",5/26/2009 1:13:00 PM,6/17/2009 12:08:00 PM,Print,pp 608-616,,"Tarko, Andrew P",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Figures, References, Tables",2009-05-00,Accident Analysis & Prevention,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Find a library where document is available,,,,,,,,,,,41,3,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

It was concluded that a RSPII was feasible and six LSIMs were selected for consideration with a RSPII framework. The LSIMs selected include the implementation of a comprehensive graduated driver licensing program, primary seat belt law, motorcycle helmet use law, sobriety checkpoints, ignition interlocks, and automated speed enforcement. A six-step RSPII framework and a pilot application are documented in this report. Two estimation methods were used to quantify the rural roadway safety impacts of primary seat belt law implementation.

Automated speed enforcement is one potential solution to reduce the number of collisions in roadway zones where speeding is a persistent problem.  This paper describes a recent study that is designed to assess the technical performance of work-zone automated speed enforcement (ASE) equipment in the field.  Several traffic monitoring systems were field tested with an ASE system at a rural two-lane highway.  The ASE equipment and other devices were found to detect 2-5 % of passing vehicles to travel in excess of 65 mph in a highway with a posted speed limit of 55 mph.  The outcome of this study, in conjunction with the experience and knowledge gained by other agencies in their development and implementation of work-zone and general ASE systems will provide valuable inputs for future safety projects.",,"TRIS, TRB",09-1732,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Automated speed enforcement, Crashes, Field tests, Operations, Traffic crashes, Traffic speed, Traffic surveillance, Two lane highways, Work zone safety, Work zone traffic control","Highways, Operations and Traffic Management, I73: Traffic Control",1/30/2009 5:59:00 PM,4/20/2009 7:45:00 AM,DVD,17p,,"Chan, Ching-Yao",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Figures, Photos, References, Tables",2009-00-00,,Transportation Research Board 88th Annual Meeting,Transportation Research Board,,,,,,,,,,Transportation Research Board,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Transportation Research Board Business Office,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

Spot speed studies were conducted prior to, within, and near the end of work zones along Interstate 10 and Interstate 95 in Florida which utilized the traditional Maintenance of Traffic plan and the MAS plan.  Both the mean and 85th percentile speeds were consistently lower at the locations where the MAS was utilized and speeds were reduced by an average of 1.5 mph. Combining MAS with targeted speed enforcement resulted in reductions of 3 to 4 mph.  The speed variance within the work zones and the proportion of speeding drivers were also shown to decrease due to the MAS.

In Arnold, Missouri, four signalized intersections are photo enforced and have been indicated with the text-only “photo-enforced” regulatory sign posted below the traditional “signal ahead” warning sign. These signs were replaced with an experimental sign that indicates a photo-enforced traffic signal ahead with a single regulatory sign. The evaluation is performed by using three surveys: one for the currently approved signage and two for the experimental sign. The second survey was conducted shortly after installation of the experimental sign, and the third survey was conducted about 9 months after installation. The study found that older drivers (age 65+ years) have greater difficulty in comprehending both the current and experimental photo-enforced signage compared with younger drivers. However, older drivers’ comprehension of the experimental sign improved more over time than other drivers’ comprehension (62.5% to 75.8% correct comprehension for older versus 79.8% to 81.2% for others).

The speed management strategies to reduce speed have been employed to prevent road accident. In order to successful implementation of speed management strategies, it is important to determine the acceptability of specific strategies which influencing from individual drivers’ attitudes. A methodology has been developed using order probit models to evaluate drivers’ attitudes towards speed management strategies. These models can determine drivers’ preferences for different speed management strategies and help planners to investigate the effect of individual characteristics on drivers’ attitude. This study based on a questionnaire survey from a random sample of 1364 drivers obtained from seven provinces in Thailand. The implementation of these strategies can be divided into two different roads; urban and interurban road. On urban road, it was found that drivers working as a commercial driver showed a negative attitude towards introducing of roundabouts, speed humps and speed limit signs. Highly educated drivers were strongly supportive the introduction of speed limit signs and speed humps. High speed drivers were found to express a strong agreement with introduction of rumble strips but show a disagreement with speed warning signs, speed limit signs and speed humps.  On interurban roads, high speed drivers show a strongly negative attitude towards all speed management strategies but express a positive attitude towards the introduction of rumble strips. Highly educated respondents expressed a strongly positive attitude towards introducing of speed limit signs and both ISA with mandatory level and voluntary level.

The techniques were using a speed Trailer, a Police car, a speed Trailer plus a Police car, and an automated Speed Photo-radar Enforcement (SPE) van. The effects on the mean speed and degree of speeding were studied at the location the treatment was implemented. The results of this research showed that in both moderately and extensively speeding sites all forms of law enforcement treatments reduced the mean speeds and speeding significantly. In the moderate-speeding site, Trailer+Police reduced the mean speeds more than the other treatments in both lanes. It reduced the mean speed of free flowing cars in median lane by 8.4 down to 48.6 mph while the other law enforcement treatments reduced it by 6.1 – 6.4 mph. In the extensive-speeding work zone, Trailer+Police and the SPE reduced the mean speeds similarly and more than Police as they reduced the mean speeds in the median lane by 7.8 mph down to 55.9 mph. In terms of speeding and excessive speeding (speeding by more than 5 mph), in the moderate-speeding site, Trailer + Police was more effective than the other treatments.

1082693,01321570,Wide central area markings´ effects on driver behaviour and opinions,Levean keskialueen tiemerkinnan vaikutukset kuljettajien kayttaytymiseen ja mielipiteisiin,DO,Finnish,,,http://alk.tiehallinto.fi/julkaisut/pdf2/3201153-v_levean_keskial_tiemerk_vaikutukset.pdf,/common/images/covers/large/1082693.png,,TRL,ITRD E219034,"The purpose of this study was to assess how a wide central area on a two-lane road, consisting of two center lines 1 m apart with a rumble strip between them, affects speed, lateral position and overtaking. Drivers were also interviewed. Wide central area markings were implemented on two test road sections on main roads 3 and 23 in the summer of 2009. There is automatic speed enforcement on both test road sections. The average speed both fell and rose on the test road sections, but the changes were under 0.5 km/h. The night time average speed of all vehicles fell by 0.5-1.2 km/h on both test road sections. The test result showed that wider, more visible markings do not always increase the night time average speed as often happens when visual guidance is improved. At night when the contrast between the road surface and the marking is greatest, the wide central area marking makes the lane look narrower. This accounts for the visual speed-reducing effect of a wide central area marking. On both test road sections drivers drove farther away from the center line after the wide central area markings had been implemented. Light vehicles drove farther away than heavy ones. On the test section on main road 3 the distance between vehicles moving in opposite directions increased more (1.16-1.46 m) than on the test section on main road 23 (0.72-1.10 m). Increased lateral separation seems to be the most notable safety effect achieved on these test road sections by the wide central area marking. The wide central area affords drivers more time for observation, decision-making and action to avoid head-on collisions. On the test section on main road 3 it was calculated that a driver's action time increased by 0.64-0.75 seconds when the off-road angle was small (5 degrees) and the speed limit 80 km/h. On the test section on main road 23 the corresponding increase of driver's action time was 0.42-0.57 seconds. The wide central area had little effect on overtaking behaviour. On the test section on main road 3, the vehicles overtook 0.017 vehicles per vehicle km both before and after application of the wide central area markings. There were few overtakings on main road 23: 0.006 overtakings per vehicle km before implementation of the wide central area markings and 0.004 subsequently. Drivers were interviewed on the test sites and bus drivers who regularly drove the test road sections were interviewed by phone. The feedback was positive and the new markings were considered to be good. Of the drivers interviewed on the test sites, 80% considered the marking to be good for traffic safety. Roughly 75% of all drivers interviewed thought that more wide central area markings should be implemented. Drivers found the marking easy to understand. The results of both the field test and drivers' interviews were encouraging. The study of long-term effects on driver behaviour and traffic safety should be continued. The effects on winter maintenance and durability of the road surface should also be studied. The wide center line markings are inexpensive to implement and their use is recommended to be extended. When new road sections are selected and new wide central area markings are implemented, the safety of pedestrians and bicycle traffic should be considered. Where a separate lane for pedestrians and bicycles does not exist, enough space should be ensured for pedestrians and cyclists on the shoulder.

There is evidence to suggest that police speed enforcement, in particular speed camera operations,  can be an effective tool for reducing traffic crashes.  This qualitative  study used focus groups with Queensland drivers to investigate knowledge, support, and impact on self-reported speeding behaviour of a variety of police speed enforcement methods.  A number of interesting themes emerged.   There were many incongruities regarding participants perceptions of current police speed enforcement policies and practices.  While participants perceived police speed enforcement as a revenue-raising tool for the Government, paradoxically they also reported it as serving a road-safety benefit.  Non-camera based methods, such as on-road traffic patrols, received stronger support and was associated with greater self-reported compliance to  speed limits than camera-based methods.  Support for camera-based methods, such as mobile speed camera vans and fixed cameras, was contingent upon  overt operations and greater perceived transparency in criteria used for  choosing camera locations.  There was also variation in the impact of camera-based methods on self-reported speeding with some participants reporting greater compliance, either site-specific or network-wide, while others  reported no or little impact on speeding behaviour.

The use of Automated Speed Enforcement programmes (ASE) appears to be one of the most promising interventions to change driver behaviour and reduce road trauma.  International experience has shown clear benefits from such programmes.  This paper compares the approaches taken by the French and Queensland Governments regarding implementation and management of ASE.  The first section summarises the historical background of both programmes and highlights the role of political leaders in the road safety arena.  The second section addresses organisational dimensions, including how the programmes are deployed and operated.  Finally, we compare the performance outcomes of each system.  We conclude by highlighting that there appears to be no single best way to implement speed enforcement measures in a ‘whole-of-jurisdiction’ approach.  Rather, lessons from the deployment of individual enforcement methods and related outcomes internationally, together with considerations of political and organizational factors, should inform speed management strategy choices.

How an average system would put the brakes on speeding drivers,,DO,English,,,,,,TRL,ITRD E140458,"When recent research suggests a very high compling with time-over-distance speed enforcement systems, is it time for a rethink on how we manage speed on our roads and highways? This article discusses the testing and action of average speed-check systems. When a vehicle enters a monitored zone, an image of the vehicle is captured by a lane-specific infrared camera for ALPR software to read the license plate, which then links the data to the image. The same information is then captured at the exit point, at which time the system collates the data and calculates whether or not a violation has occurred.

875592,01115877,"Annual performance indicators of enforced driver behaviours in South Australia, 2005",,DO,English,,,,,,ARRB,ITRD E216949,"This report was produced to quantify performance indicators for selected enforced driver behaviours (drink driving, speeding and restraint use) in South Australia for the calendar year 2005.   Note that there were considerable problems with data on police enforcement operations and detections in 2005.  Consequently, some 2005 data were not available for this report.   The level of random breath testing (RBT) in South Australia in 2005 was slightly lower than in 2004.  The abolition of the requirement for mobile RBT to be conducted only during prescribed periods in mid 2005 was responsible for an increase in the proportion of tests conducted using mobile RBT.  The increase in mobile testing led to an increase in the overall detection rate.  However, interstate comparisons suggest the level of testing and the proportion of testing using mobile RBT should be increased further  in South Australia.  The proportion of mobile testing is expected to be more comparable with other states in 2006, when mobile methods would have operated on an unrestricted basis for 12 months.  There was a marked increase (34 per cent) in number of hours spent on speed detection in 2005, despite three months of speed camera inactivity.  The detection rate (per hour of enforcement and per 1,000 vehicles passing speed cameras) continued to decrease in 2005 to the lowest of all years since records began in 2000.   The finding of a low detection rate combined with an increase in the hours of speed detection in 2005 suggests the possibility of the positive effects of increased levels of speed enforcement.  Urban and rural speed surveys were conducted in 2005.  They revealed that reductions in speeds on 50 km/h urban roads in 2003 were maintained in 2005 but speeds on 60, 100 and 110km/h rural roads increased. The number of restraint offences in 2005  was slightly lower than the number in 2004. The amount of publicity supporting restraint use increased by 27 per cent in 2005 and involved a new mass media campaign in both metropolitan and rural areas.

887451,01127594,Detection Inspectors: Sophisticated Technologies are Helping to Keep the World Roads and Bridges Running Smoothly,,DO,English,,,,,,UC Berkeley Transportation Library,,"This is an overview of various new vehicle-detection technologies being developed and deployed to provide speed monitoring, traffic counting, presence detection, headway measurement, vehicle classification, and weigh-in-motion (WIM) data. Their purposes range from ensuring that highways run as efficiently as possible to making sure that roads are not damaged because overweight vehicles are using them. A new automatic number plate recognition camera, combined with a journey time system, uses a web server and an integrated software system package. It allows neighboring jurisdictions to link to and share one another’s data. Another device uses a complementary metal-oxidesemi-conductor sensor (CMOS) and video detection technology. Its main use is in stop bar and advance detection at or near signalized intersections. Temporary traffic monitoring can be done with a closed circuit television (CCTV) system to observe traffic flow on a portion of road where a long-term contraflow is in operation during a major road construction project. Pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) cameras track traffic on key bridges and overpasses in another jurisdiction. They use a proprietary software system that allows the imagery to be integrated into an existing traffic management system. Light detection and ranging (LIDAR) technology is being used to provide speed enforcement on up to three lanes of traffic. Finally, a new traffic camera system uses an in-image triggering system to allow a complete solution for traffic management and vehicle imaging. The system is self-contained and self-triggering, and uses ambient light and infrared light to determine when it should capture the vehicle’s license plate.",,"BTRIS, TRIS",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Automatic vehicle classification, Automatic vehicle detection and identification systems, Automatic vehicle identification, Automatic vehicle monitoring, Traffic speed, Traffic speed measurement, Traffic surveillance, Vehicle detectors, Video imaging detectors, Weigh in motion","Highways, Operations and Traffic Management, I73: Traffic Control",4/9/2009 5:15:00 PM,4/30/2009 8:28:00 AM,Print,pp 49-52,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Photos,2008-07-00,World Highways/Routes du Monde,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Find a library where document is available,,,,,,,,,,,17,6,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

In the case of speeding this has proven to be one of the more significant contributing factors in road crashes and the resulting harm generated.  In particular in the PRC the significant number of pedestrian fatalities will benefit from speed reduction approaches that will have an impact on the severity and frequency of crashes.

868458,01109045,Changing America’s Culture of Speed on the Roads,,DO,English,,,,,,,,"Speeding—exceeding the posted speed limit or traveling too fast for conditions—is epidemic on America’s highways. Most drivers understand that speeding is dangerous, and most drivers feel that other speeders threaten their own personal safety. Yet most drivers speed: in a recent national survey, about 80% of all drivers said they exceeded the speed limit on all types of roads, from Interstate highways to neighborhood streets, within the past month, and about one-third reported that they were speeding on the day of the interview. Speeding increases both the risk of a crash and the risk of injuries and fatalities in crashes. Speeding was documented in almost one-third of all fatal traffic crashes in 2005 and probably was involved in many more. American culture encourages speeding. Many roads are designed for speeds higher than the posted speed limit. Cars are comfortable, quiet, insulated from the road, with speedometers recording speeds over 100 mph; drivers don’t feel that they are traveling fast. Television, movies, and electronic games all promote speeding. Automobile companies and car magazines advertise speed through slogans such as “0 to 60 mph in 3.4 seconds.” And Americans’ busy lifestyles stress that every minute counts, that in days filled with multiple appointments in different locations, we need to get from one place to the next as quickly as we can—so we speed. Current methods for controlling speeding are virtually powerless in the face of this speeding culture. Police can detect speeders easily, but police can patrol only a tiny fraction of the nation’s four million highway miles. On congested multilane roads, police cannot safely single out one car from the hundreds that speed by every minute. The common attitude is that police issue speeding tickets to raise revenue, not to protect the driving public. Automated speed enforcement has demonstrated its effectiveness in other countries but is used only rarely in America. So what can be done to reduce speeding? The public’s attitudes that accept and often encourage speeding must change, and at the same time speeding behavior must be reduced and stopped in locations and situations where the public knows that speeding is dangerous. Two good targets are 1) specific high-visibility locations, such as school zones, neighborhood streets where children live, highway work zones, and streets with heavy pedestrian crossing traffic and 2) extreme speeders who drive more than ten or twenty mph faster than other vehicles. Well-publicized campaigns focused on these targets, using both manned and automated enforcement methods, can begin changing public attitudes. They require vigorous local, state, and national leadership that recognizes the true role of speed in traffic crashes and injuries, makes speed a real safety priority, increases funding for speed-related programs and research, and uses leadership’s “bully pulpit” to inform, encourage, and inspire America’s drivers to drive at safe speeds.",,"TRIS, USDOT",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Attitudes, Automated enforcement, Behavior, Countermeasures, Crash causes, Culture (Social sciences), Highway safety, Leadership, Public information programs, Safety campaigns, Speed control, Speed limits, Speeding, Traffic crashes, Traffic law enforcement, Traffic safety, United States","Administration and Management, Highways, Safety and Human Factors, Security and Emergencies, Society, I80: Accident Studies",8/15/2008 4:28:00 PM,8/22/2008 8:42:00 AM,CD-ROM,16p,,"Harsha, Barbara","Hedlund, James",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,References,2008-00-00,,ITE 2008 Technical Conference and Exhibit,Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE),Federal Highway Administration,,,,,,,,,Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE),Federal Highway Administration,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

The CTST’s are groups that typically meet monthly to try to address traffic safety issues. They bring together people in engineering, enforcement, emergency services, education, and many of the other ""E's"" that we need to have a truly effective multi-disciplinary approach to safety. This paper will focus on the success stories from bringing this training to the CTST members, and the benefits that the agencies and teams enjoy from the RSA experience. Law-enforcement representatives have expressed that the experience will help them to prepare better crash reports, which should lead to better crash data in the future. Engineering agency attendees have indicated that they are more aware now of the safety needs on their roadways. By taking advantage of the multi-disciplinary nature of the CTSTs, a very comprehensive approach to improved safety can be developed. Where increased speed enforcement is needed, the enforcement agencies can step up their presence. Where engineering countermeasures are needed, they can be implemented. Where both are needed, with a complementing education campaign, the team can develop the appropriate plan.

The effectiveness of speed photo enforcement (SPE) (by radar) in reducing speeds and increasing speed limit compliance in work zones was evaluated for the first time in the United States, at Illinois work zones. Details are presented on SPE implementation and its effectiveness at the point it was stationed and at a downstream location in a work zone. Speed data were collected at the location of SPE and at a location 1.5 mi downstream in the work zone to determine the point and spatial effects of SPE. Speeds were measured for free-flowing and platooned cars and heavy vehicles in shoulder and median lanes. Results showed that SPE is effective in reducing the average speed and increasing compliance with work zone speed limit. The SPE reduced speed in the median lane more than in the shoulder lane, as expected. In addition, the speed of free-flowing vehicles was reduced more than for platooned vehicles. The reduction of the mean speed varied from 3.2 to 7.3 mph. The percentage of vehicles exceeding the speed limit near SPE was reduced from about 40% to 8% for free-flowing cars and from 17% to 4% for free-flowing heavy vehicles. Near the SPE van, none of the cars exceeded the speed limit by more than 10 mph, and none of the heavy vehicles exceeded it by more than 5 mph. The data also showed a mixed spatial effect for SPE.

Automated speed enforcement programs have been widely applied outside of the U.S. to effectively address speeding-related safety problems. In the U.S., automated speed enforcement programs are currently operated in only 11 states and in Washington D.C., most of which are located on residential streets and not highways. Moreover, a number of automated speed enforcement programs have been discontinued since 1990. This literature review explores the potential benefits and barriers to implementing automated speed enforcement programs in the U.S. by examining the large body of literature on automated enforcement programs, including red-light and speed programs. It begins with background on the implementation of automated speed enforcement and includes a discussion of research on the potential safety and financial effects of these programs. Next, the legal restrictions to the implementation of automated speed enforcement in the U.S. are outlined. This is followed by a discussion of stakeholder support including potential concerns of citizens, special interest groups, elected officials, and governmental agencies. Then, an evaluation of key program design choices is provided, encompassing issues related to owner or driver liability, manned or unmanned systems, mobile or fixed systems, visibility, location, enforcement thresholds, program management, and revenue distribution.

Several semi- and fully automated techniques for determining the number of persons in a moving vehicle, including operator-monitored video cameras and infrared composite imaging, have undergone limited field testing. The technical merits of in-vehicle and roadside systems for automated vehicle occupancy verification systems have been examined extensively. This paper complements those efforts by providing the policy and legal implications of automated systems for occupancy enforcement. The primary form of automated enforcement technology currently used in the United States is photographic imagery recorded by automated violation detection systems. For moving violations, these systems almost exclusively take the form of red light and speed enforcement, unlike toll evasion, which is typically punishable as an infraction. Principal objections to automated enforcement for occupancy purposes have involved privacy and due process concerns. Under an automated occupancy enforcement tool, the occupancy enforcement regime would likely face the same legal and privacy challenges as automated enforcement cameras and similar devices. This paper examines the current legislation related to automated enforcement practices, as well as an illustration of the arguments against their use. These arguments raise questions about the legality of automated enforcement systems and the perceived invasion of privacy some drivers may associate with such systems. The three primary privacy issues associated with an automated system for occupancy enforcement concern the photographic record of occupants, vehicle infrastructure integration barriers, and the legal definition of a high-occupancy vehicle infraction.",,"TRIS, TRB, ATRI",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Automated enforcement, Detection and identification systems, Due process, Laws and legislation, Legal factors, Managed lanes, Policy, Privacy, Traffic law enforcement, Traffic violations, Vehicle occupancy","Highways, Law, Operations and Traffic Management, I73: Traffic Control",1/29/2008 4:04:00 PM,12/5/2008 8:56:00 AM,Print,pp 41-46,,"Ungemah, David H","Lowery, John","Wikander, John","Goodin, Ginger D",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"References, Tables",2008-00-00,Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Transportation Research Board Business Office,Find a library where document is available,,,,,,,,,9780309113373,,2065,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

Findings from a previous study done for the North Carolina Governor’s Highway Safety Program were updated. The first, and primary, analysis was a before-and-after analysis of collisions. This study used Hauer’s comparison group methodology. Three different collision data sets were analyzed: total collisions, data accounting for regression to the mean, and data for five heavily enforced corridors. On the basis of the analysis, the impact of regression to the mean appears to be negligible. The results indicate that the camera program likely reduced collisions in corridors with automated enforcement. The second analysis observed whether compliance with posted speed limits was enhanced. Mean speeds, median speeds, 85th percentile speeds, and percentages of drivers more than 10 mph over the speed limit were analyzed. The analyses found speed reductions caused by the camera program.

The methodology is based on the relationship between speed and capacity in work zones. Speed is adjusted to account for the adverse effects of roadway geometrics, work intensity, speed enforcement, and other work zone factors. Speed reductions for work intensity and narrow lane widths were determined previously by use of data from work zones. Values from the ""Highway Capacity Manual"" were used where data from work zones were not available. The fundamental difference between this methodology and previous approaches is that it accounts for the various work zone factors. Two applications of the methodology are presented, one with queuing and one without queuing, to real-world work zones. Results are compared with field data. For the nonqueuing site, the computed speed and capacity were 44.4 mph and 1,778 vehicles per hour per lane (vphpl), respectively, while the field speed and capacity were 44 mph and 1,708 vphpl, respectively. For the queuing site, computed capacity was 1,012 vphpl while the field capacity was 1,220 vphpl.

848632,01095606,Addressing Inappropriate Driver Behavior at Rail-Highway Crossings,,DO,English,,,,,,,Transportation Research Board Annual Meeting 2008 Paper #08-2557,"Driver behavior at rail highway crossings has been the subject of numerous studies, most of which show that violations are relatively commonplace. The focus of this paper will be on those drivers who drive around fully descended gates. Drivers commonly misjudge the speed and distance of trains. They must make a decision about the time remaining before the train arrives based on sensory signals as well as non-sensory factors such as expectations and motivation. At a gated crossing, where drivers have been alerted to the imminent danger by the lowered gates, there is more to be gained by preventing gate running, or at least making it very difficult, then by attempting to aid drivers in making a better informed decision as to whether or not there is sufficient time to clear the crossing before the train arrives. This is especially true given people’s innate inability to judge the speed of a large object coming directly at them, both because the growth in size is not linear, and because human vision underestimates the speed of large objects. Given the costs involved in closing or making a crossing impenetrable, it is worthwhile looking at other approaches that can cost effectively reduce gate-running.

In 2007, Montgomery County, Maryland, implemented the state's first automated speed enforcement program, with camera use limited to residential streets with speeds limits of 35 mph or less and school zones. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate initial effects of camera enforcement on traffic speeds and to assess public attitudes. Vehicle speeds were measured approximately six months before and six months after speed cameras were deployed and warning signs were installed. Speed data were collected on a sample of roads with and without camera enforcement in Montgomery County, as well as on a sample of roads in a comparison community that did not have speed cameras. In addition, telephone surveys were conducted in Montgomery County. Relative to speeds of drivers on roads in the comparison community, the proportion of drivers in Montgomery County traveling more than 10 mph above posted speed limits declined by about 70% at locations with both warning signs and speed camera enforcement, 39% at locations with warning signs but no speed cameras, and 16% on residential streets with neither warning signs nor speed cameras. Public opinion surveys found 74% of Montgomery County drivers thought speeding on residential streets was a problem. Six months after enforcement began, 60% of drivers were aware of the camera program and 62% supported it. The camera program was effective at reducing speeding on targeted streets. The finding of speed reductions beyond targeted locations is evidence that highly visible automated enforcement can promote community-wide changes in driver behavior. Although a majority of drivers supported automated speed enforcement, about one third opposed it.

Armed with advanced text-mining algorithms, this study enables LPR technology for real-time enforcement by matching plates whether correctly or incorrectly read at various locations in a network or along a corridor and, hence, tracking the movement and speed of vehicles. The focus of the project is on heavy vehicles as they are required to enter weigh stations, where the LPR tracking information can be used, in real time, for speed enforcement and/or as a triggering factor for other inspectional activities. The first phase of the project, which is reported herein, saw the development of the enabling text-mining algorithm and the demonstration of plate matching rate improvement from less than 60% to better than 90%. The second phase will deploy the LPR technology and matching algorithm in real-time so that a trooper sitting in the weigh house can warn a truck driver, in person and within minutes, of his or her speeding offense without having to chase the truck down in a patrol car. The initial objective of the study is to devise an inexpensive and effective means for helping improve air quality in non-attainment metropolitan areas through speed enforcement. The successful deployment of such a measure can also potentially lead to improved highway safety, fuel efficiency, and national security.",This document is disseminated under the sponsorship of the Department of Transportation University Transportation Centers Program.,"UTC, TRIS, USDOT",,,,,,,,,,,DTRT06G-0043,,,,,,,,,,"Air quality management, Automatic license plate readers, Heavy duty vehicles, Real time information, Speeding, Traffic law enforcement, Trucking, Weigh stations","Environment, Highways, Operations and Traffic Management, I15: Environment, I73: Traffic Control",6/23/2009 11:37:00 AM,8/8/2011 2:11:00 PM,Print,23p,,"Han, Lee D","Jeong, Myong-Kee","Oliveira-Neto, Francisco Moraes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Figures, Photos, References, Tables",2008-00-00,,,,,,,,,,,,,"National Transportation Research Center, Incorporated",Research and Innovative Technology Administration,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"National Transportation Research Center, Incorporated",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

The U.K. is the home of ALPR, and many of the leading deployments of the technology can be found there. One company has developed a capability of reading license plates from multiple nationalities. A new development is the use of white light, versus the longtime standard, infrared, because it can read non-reflective plates as accurately as reflective ones. Another product is a high-definition camera that can read two lanes with only one pole and no need for a gantry. Cameras read license plate colors differently than the human eye, so that black plates are actually easier to read than bright ones.

835546,01076650,Overall Impact During 2001-2004 of Victorian Speed-Related Package,,DO,English,,,http://www.monash.edu.au/muarc/reports/muarc267.pdf,/common/images/covers/large/835546.png,,,,"From December 2000 until July 2002, three new speed enforcement initiatives were implemented in Victoria.  These initiatives were introduced in stages and involved the following key components: More covert operations of mobile speed cameras, including flash-less operations; 50% increase in speed camera operating hours; and lowering of cameras' speed detection threshold.  In addition, during the period 2001 to 2002, the 50 km/h General Urban Speed Limit (GUSL) was introduced (January 2001), there was an increase in speed-related advertising including the ""Wipe Off 5"" campaign, media announcements were made related to the above enforcement initiatives and there was a speeding penalty restructure.  The above elements combine to make up a package of speed-related initiatives and factors.  The broad aim of this study was to evaluate the overall effectiveness of the speed-related package.  This report presents the results of the overall impact during 2001-2004 of the speed-related initiatives on crash outcomes.  Evaluation of the crash effects of the Victorian speed-related package has shown clear reductions in the number of casualty crashes associated with its implementation.  The package was associated with a highly statistically significant estimated overall reduction in casualty crashes of 3.8%.  This reduction was due largely to the highly statistically significant 4.6% estimated reduction in casualty crashes in metropolitan Melbourne.  Analysis of the proportion of casualty crashes that were fatal suggested a possible reduction in the risk of fatal outcome in casualty crashes with a non-statistically significant estimated relative crash injury severity of 0.96 whist analysis of the proportion of fatal or serious injury crashes that were fatal showed a statistically significant reduction in the risk of fatal outcome in the serious casualty crash subset with an estimated relative crash injury severity of 0.86.  Both measures of severity showed non-statistically significant estimated reductions in the risk of fatal outcome of 20% for casualty crashes involving pedestrians over the post-implementation period.  Since the key component initiatives were implemented in a staggered way, the overall results were partitioned by time in order to assess changes in the crash outcomes over time during the post-implementation period.  Because of the staggered implementation, it could be argued that the final partitioned period of July 2004 to December 2004 inclusive best reflects the full effect of the speed-related package on crash outcomes.  This period showed a highly statistically significant estimated crash reduction of 10% in casualty crashes, with a non-statistically significant estimated relative crash injury severity of 0.81 occurring for the proportion of casualty crashes resulting in fatal outcome.  Compounding these results gave a statistically significant estimated reduction in fatal crashes of 27% with a 95% confidence interval of (5.9%, 48%). Given that 136 fatal crashes were observed during this 6 month period, the number of fatal crashes that would have been expected if the speed-related package had not been implemented was estimated to be 186 (145, 259); this equates to a saving of just over 8 (1, 21) fatal crashes per month.",,"TRIS, ATRI",267,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Advertising campaigns, Cameras, Casualties, Countermeasures, Crash injuries, Fatalities, Highway safety, Hours of operation, Injury severity, Mass media, Penalties, Safety campaigns, Speed control, Speed detectors, Speed limits, Speeding, Statistical analysis, Traffic crashes, Traffic law enforcement, Traffic safety, Victoria (Australia)","Data and Information Technology, Highways, Law, Safety and Human Factors",9/17/2007 12:05:00 PM,5/13/2009 3:58:00 AM,Web,56p,,"D'Elia, Angelo","Newstead, Stuart","Cameron, Max",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Appendices, Figures, References, Tables",2007-07-00,,,,,,,,,,,,,Monash University,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Find a library where document is available,,,,,,,,,,0732623375,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

This report covers their application to monthly casualty crash frequencies and injury severity outcomes in Victoria during 1998 to 2003.  During 2000 to 2003, the mobile speed camera program in Victoria was changed by introducing ""flashless"" camera operations during daytime and other modifications to make the enforcement more covert and unpredictable, increasing the targeted camera operating hours from 4200 to 6000 hours per month, and reducing the speeding offence detection threshold in three stages.  In December 2002, the thresholds for penalties applying to different levels of speeding offence were generally reduced by 5 km/h.  Associated with the speed enforcement initiatives was a program of speed-related advertising known as the ""Wipe Off 5"" campaign launched in early August 2001 without specific reference to the enforcement changes.  A subsequent announcement took place in late November 2001 specifically mentioning the more covert speed camera operations as well as the increase in camera hours.  A third announcement took place in the print media at the end of March 2002, emphasizing that the former 9 km/h speeding tolerance no longer applied.  As well as the enforcement changes, the statistical models included the reduced urban speed limit in January 2001, the penalty restructure, the speed-related advertising and the announcements, plus the impact of the fixed speed camera controversy that arose in late 2003.  The study concluded that linear modelling of crash outcomes as a function of potential explanatory factors needs realistic assumptions to be made about viable functional forms connecting a measure of each factor and the outcomes.  The assumed functional form of the relationship between monthly speed camera hours and road trauma appears to represent this relationship well.  There is doubt that the flashless speed camera initiative and the enforcement threshold reductions have been adequately represented in the monthly crash outcome models.  It was concluded that the effect of these initiatives on crash outcomes is unknown at this stage.  The assumed functional form of the relationship between monthly speed-related advertising levels and road trauma appears to represent this relationship well.  The speed-related television advertising had a statistically significant association with a decrease in monthly casualty crash frequencies during times of increased advertising levels.  In general the relationships connecting speed camera hours and levels of speed-related advertising with road trauma reductions in Victoria confirmed previous research on the effectiveness of these road safety programs as operated in the State.",,"TRIS, ATRI",268,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Advertising campaigns, Cameras, Countermeasures, Crash rates, Highway safety, Hours of operation, Injury severity, Linear modeling, Penalties, Safety campaigns, Speed, Speed control, Speed limits, Speeding, Thresholds, Tolerance (Psychology), Traffic crashes, Traffic law enforcement, Traffic safety, Urban areas, Victoria (Australia)","Highways, Law, Safety and Human Factors",9/20/2007 12:28:00 PM,5/13/2009 3:56:00 AM,Web,104p,,"Bobevski, Irene","Hosking, Simon","Oxley, Penny","Cameron, Max",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Appendices, Figures, References, Tables",2007-07-00,,,,,,,,,,,,,Monash University,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Find a library where document is available,,,,,,,,,,0732623383,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

A systematic literature search was conducted. Criteria for selecting key evaluation studies were developed and applied for two AES technologies: speed camera and red light camera (RLC) enforcement systems. For automated speed enforcement, key studies reported significant reductions in estimated crashes following program implementation, but only a few studies were well-controlled. The degree to which reported safety improvements are related to the treatment and desired behavioral change (decrease in speeds) as opposed to regression to the mean (RTM), other confounders, and behavior changes such as choosing alternate routes, cannot be stated with certainty. Most studies attempted to account for unknown and time-related crash trends through the use of comparison groups. Four studies considered RTM, while only one study accounted directly for traffic flow changes and effects on crashes. Speed reductions documented in about half of the studies provided support for a relationship between the treatments and crash reductions. Enforcement intensity of mobile enforcements, site-specific differences (e.g., sample area, roadway characteristics), and statistical anomalies may play a role in AES effects. Recommendations for future studies include the use of empirical Bayes (EB) procedures to control for RTM, careful selection and examination of comparison groups, and consideration of traffic flow effects and possible crash migration due to the treatment, in order to improve the accuracy of treatment safety effect estimates. For red light running enforcement, the key studies support the assertion that RLCs can reduce crash severity at high red light running intersections. Consistent with previous reports, this review attributes a decrease in right-angle crashes with an increase in rear-end crashes to RLC implementations, together with a decrease in red light running violations. Recommendations for future studies of RLC effects include the use of controlled and randomized experiments whenever feasible. Otherwise, adjustments in before- and after- designs with matched control locations (or jurisdictions) to take legal, ethical, and economic barriers to random assignment of RLC installations into account, plus the use of EB procedures to control for RTM and to improve the precision of estimates of treatment safety effects, are strongly recommended.",,"HSL, NTL, TRIS, ATRI, USDOT",HS-810 763,,,,,,,,,,DTNH22-05-D-05043; Project No. NTS-01-5-05127,,,,,,,,,,"Automated enforcement, Before and after studies, Behavior, Cameras, Countermeasures, Crash severity, Highway safety, Literature reviews, Rear end crashes, Red light running, Regression analysis, Right angle crashes, Speeding, Traffic crashes, Traffic flow, Traffic law enforcement, Traffic safety","Data and Information Technology, Highways, Safety and Human Factors, Security and Emergencies, I83: Accidents and the Human Factor",10/19/2007 1:32:00 PM,5/13/2009 3:22:00 AM,Web,136p,,"Decina, Lawrence E","Thomas, Libby","Srinivasan, Raghavan","Staplin, Loren",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bibliography, References, Tables",2007-07-00,,,,,,,,,,,,,"TransAnalytics, LLC",National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,National Technical Information Service,,,,,,,,,,,,,Final Report,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

842586,01083350,The Impact of Red Light Cameras (Photo-Red Enforcement) on Crashes in Virginia,,DO,English,,,http://www.virginiadot.org/vtrc/main/online_reports/pdf/07-r2.pdf,/common/images/covers/large/842586.png,,,,"Red light running is a significant public health concern, killing more than 800 people and injuring 200,000 in the United States per year (Retting et al., 1999a; Retting and Kyrychenko, 2002). To reduce red light running in Virginia, six jurisdictions (Alexandria, Arlington, Fairfax City, Fairfax County, Falls Church, Vienna) deployed red light cameras at some point during the 10-year period when they were permitted under Virginia law. This report documents the safety impacts of those cameras based on 7 years of crash data for the period January 1, 1998, through December 31, 2004. Consistent with the findings of a previous Virginia study (Garber et al., 2005), this study finds that cameras are associated with an increase in rear-end crashes (about 27% or 42% depending on the statistical method used) and a decrease in red light running crashes (about 8% or 42% depending on the statistical method used). This report also shows that there is significant variation by intersection and by jurisdiction: one jurisdiction (Arlington) suggests that cameras are associated with an increase in all six crash types that were explicitly studied (rear-end, angle, red light running, injury red light running, total injury, and total) whereas two other jurisdictions saw decreases in most of these crash types. It is therefore not surprising that when the comprehensive crash costs for rear-end and angle crashes are monetized, the cameras are associated with an increase in crash costs in some jurisdictions (e.g., an annual increase of $140,883 in Arlington) and a net reduction in comprehensive crash costs in other jurisdictions (e.g., an annual reduction of $92,367 in Vienna). When these results are aggregated across all six jurisdictions, the cameras are associated with a net increase in comprehensive crash costs. However, when considering only injury crashes, if the three fatal angle crashes that occurred during the after period are removed from the analysis (the only fatalities that occurred during the study out of 1,168 injury crashes), then the cameras were associated with a modest reduction in the comprehensive crash cost for injury crashes only. These results cannot be used to justify the widespread installation of cameras because they are not universally effective. These results also cannot be used to justify the abolition of cameras, as they have had a positive impact at some intersections and in some jurisdictions. The report recommends, therefore, that the decision to install a red light camera be made on an intersection-by-intersection basis. In addition, it is recommended that a carefully controlled experiment be conducted to examine further the impact of red light programs on safety and to determine how an increase in rear-end crashes can be avoided at specific intersections.",,"TRIS, ATRI, USDOT, STATEDOT",FHWA/VTRC 07-R2,,,,,,,,,,79723,,,,,,,,,,"Accident costs, Cameras, Costs, Crashes, Field studies, Photo enforcement, Rear end crashes, Red light running, Right angle crashes, Traffic law enforcement, Traffic safety, Virginia","Finance, Highways, Safety and Human Factors, I80: Accident Studies",1/3/2008 6:41:00 PM,5/13/2009 2:21:00 AM,Web,147p,,"Garber, Nicholas J","Miller, John S","Abel, R Elizabeth","Eslambolchi, Saeed","Korukonda, Santhosh K",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Appendices, Figures, References, Tables",2007-06-00,,,,,,,,,,,,,Virginia Transportation Research Council,Virginia Department of Transportation,Federal Highway Administration,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,National Technical Information Service,,,,,,,,,,,,,Final Report,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

Speeds were measured at the five demonstration school zones and at five comparison school zones before, during, and after the demonstration. Public awareness was measured before and during the ASE demonstration. Major findings follow: (1) Mean and 85th percentile speeds at demonstration school zones were reduced by approximately 5 mph when ASE was present, and ASE still had an effect (although reduced to 1 to 2 mph) when ASE was not present. The proportion of traffic that exceeded the speed limit by more than 10 mph was reduced by about two-thirds when ASE was present, and by about one-quarter when ASE was not present. (2) Maximum speed reduction was obtained with the combination of ASE and a flashing beacon, which is used during certain hours at many Portland school zones. (3) The speed reduction effects observed at the demonstration school zones were still present one month after ASE operations ceased in May 2005.

The overall goal was to reduce the number of fatal and life-changing crashes on Minnesota highways. The MSMP involved a speed limit adjustment—on 850 miles of Minnesota’s 55 mph highways the speed limit was increased to 60 mph. It involved increased speed enforcement—by State Patrol, county sheriffs, and local law enforcement—on selected highways. There were four waves of Enhanced Enforcement (one of six weeks, three of eight weeks) each followed by four weeks of Regular Enforcement. The MSMP involved extensive public education, organized by the Office of Traffic Safety, with approximately 10,000 public service messages presented on the radio. Two evaluation efforts were conducted. The University of Minnesota compared travel speed data and crash data obtained during the MSMP with historical data. Throughout the MSMP, there were decreases in the number of drivers traveling at least 10 mph above the speed limits—decreases of -28.7% on 2-Lane/2-Way Highways; -28.7% on 4-Lane Divided Highways; -42.9% on Rural Freeways; and -11.2% on Urban Freeways. The University’s evaluation also showed there were reductions in the numbers of fatal and life-changing crashes during the MSMP. MarketLine Research conducted the second evaluation, using telephone surveys, and found nine in ten drivers support the speed limit increase from 55 mph to 60 mph in both Metro and Greater Minnesota. The MSMP, in concert with other efforts that are part of the Minnesota Comprehensive Highway Safety Plan, resulted in reductions in the number of speeders on Minnesota Highways and reductions in the number of fatal and life-changing crashes—making Minnesota’s roads safer.",,"TRIS, STATEDOT",MN/RC-2007-21,,,,,,,,,,(c) 81655 (wo) 199,,,,,,,,,,"Crash data, Fatalities, Highway safety, Minnesota, Radio, Speed, Speed control, Speed limits, Speeding, Traffic law enforcement, Traffic safety education, Types of roads","Education and Training, Highways, Safety and Human Factors, I83: Accidents and the Human Factor",7/2/2007 9:23:00 AM,3/28/2016 8:10:00 AM,Web,68p,,"Harder, Kathleen A","Bloomfield, John R",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Figures, Maps, Photos, References, Tables",2007-05-00,,,,,,,,,,,,,"University of Minnesota, Twin Cities",Minnesota Department of Transportation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,National Technical Information Service,,,,,,,,,,,,,Final Report,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

After removal of instances of interference, 1538 driving behaviors were recorded. Multiple regression was then utilized to examine the factors affecting approaching speed. Speed limit violation was considered a dichotomous variable with two categories, violation and compliance. Binary logistic regression was also used to examine the risk of speeding as a function of covariates and interaction terms. The results of analysis revealed that the major contributing factors for approaching speed were site, rush-hour-status, traffic light condition, vehicle type and driver gender. In particular, light status was the highest contributor to speed. In addition, the results of logistic regression showed significant sites and rush-hour effects on speeding, with the risk of limit violation in the suburbs nearly six-fold that in urban areas. The relative risk of speeding for travelling in non-rush hours is three times higher than that for rush-hour. In terms of driver characteristics, male drivers under 55 years of age had the greatest speeding propensity in our sample.

The data was collected as part of the British Crime Survey, a face-to-face interview with UK residents on issues relating to crime. The antisocial behavior section required participants to state the degree to which they perceived 16 antisocial behaviors to be a problem in their area. Results revealed that speeding traffic was perceived as the greatest problem in local communities, regardless of whether respondents were male or female, young, middle aged, or old. The rating of speeding traffic as the greatest problem in the community was replicated in a second, smaller postal survey, where respondents also provided strong support for enforcement on residential roads, and indicated that traveling immediately above the speed limit on residential roads was unacceptable.

Red light violation behavior was examined using about 47,000 violation records that were captured by photo enforcement cameras from 11 signalized intersections in the city of Sacramento, California, over a four-year period. This examination identified factors with strong correlation to red light running behavior.  Key findings based on Sacramento's red light violation records include: (a) younger drivers showed a higher tendency of running the red light and were more likely to commit such a violation at speeds above the posted speed limit; (b) off-peak time period between 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. had lower violation counts, but red light violators in this time frame had a higher propensity of racing through intersections at high speeds; (c) also during the time period between 8 p.m. to 5 a.m., violators showed a higher probability of entering intersections two or more seconds after the onset of red light; and (d) violators were less likely to cross high traffic-volume intersections with speeds greater than the posted speed limit.  Sacramento's data suggest that some red light violators might have committed such an offense unintentionally. The top three violation speeds were all below 20 mph and more than 94% of red light runners crossed intersections within 2 seconds after the onset of the red light.  In the next several years, studies will be executed to assess whether a red light violation warning system can reduce “unintentional red light running” such as drivers who made incorrect judgment regarding the adequate time to clear the intersection and inattentive motorists who fail to observe the presence and status of the red light.",Abstract reprinted with permission from Elsevier,"TRIS, ATRI",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Behavior, Driver errors, Driver support systems, Drivers, Periods of the day, Red light cameras, Red light running, Regression analysis, Sacramento (California), Signalized intersections, Speed, Traffic violations, Traffic violators","Data and Information Technology, Highways, Safety and Human Factors, Security and Emergencies, I83: Accidents and the Human Factor",8/5/2007 11:39:00 PM,8/23/2007 1:00:00 PM,Print,pp 311-321,,"Yang, C Y David","Najm, Wassim G",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Figures, References, Tables",2007-00-00,Journal of Safety Research,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Find a library where document is available,,,,,,,,,,,38,3,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

Therefore, conventional traffic enforcement should be supplemented with advanced technologies, such as intersection safety cameras. Intersection safety cameras, often referred to as red light cameras (RLCs), are being used increasingly to help communities enforce against deliberate red light running. Since the 1970s, Europe, Australia, and North America have been using photo enforcement technology to improve safety at intersections. The City of Edmonton, Canada, has used automated photo enforcement as part of the overall traffic enforcement activity. The Intersection Safety Camera Program started as a pilot project in 1998, which quickly expanded into a comprehensive program for the entire city. Because a significant period had elapsed since the inception of the program, the Edmonton Police Commission wanted a study to determine the overall safety effect of the photo enforcement program. This paper describes the evaluation of Edmonton’s Intersection Safety Camera (ISC) program. The paper describes the methodology used in the evaluation, the data collection–compilation effort required for the evaluation, and, finally, the results of the program measured in relation to reducing the number of collisions at the intersections that were treated with photo enforcement cameras.

In SWOV's 2003-2006 research programme, two projects examined this extensively. These were Analysis of speed, speed distribution and safety and Measures for speed enforcement. All sorts of activities took place within these projects.  This report is the final report of these activities and briefly describes the most important ideas and the results of literature studies, analyses, and a number of empirical studies. The following subjects were dealt with:  (1) the relation between speed, crash risk, and crash severity;  (2) the factors that influence motorists' speed choice;  (3) a vision of the short-term approach to the speeding problem;  (4) an overview of measures for speed management.  The report then zooms in on three specific measures for speed management which the SWOV research programme has paid special attention to:  (1) credible speed limits;  (2) speed enforcement;  (3) Intelligent Speed Assistance (ISA).  The subject of speed management has many aspects. This report shows that in SWOV's 2003-2006 research programme they studied many of these aspects, they obtained new knowledge in various areas and sorted out existing knowledge. In particular they made a great deal of progress in the aspect of credible speed limits.  This of course does not mean that we now know everything; that's far from being the case.

These systems were originally selected as the most effective safety measure to cover a long section of road, but subsequent analysis has shown that the flow characteristics ofvehicles through these speed control sections has improved. Data shows that within a SPECS controlled zone, average speeds and 85th percentile speeds reduce; but speed variability is also reduced, resulting in smoother traffic flows with greater, more reliable vehicle throughput. This is in addition to the lower killed and seriously injured (KSI) figures that were the original justification for enforcement. With congestion targets becomingincreasingly important, it is suggested that the control of average speed is the key to reliable and safe journeys, with road user charges only being applied to those drivers who choose to speed .

Present state and possibilities,Nopeudenhallinnan nykytila ja mahdollisuudet,DO,Finnish,,,http://www.lintu.info/NOPHA.pdf,/common/images/covers/large/840882.png,,TRL,ITRD E214454,"High travel speeds are generally considered a benefit, but small speed changes on the road network do not significantly affect the time used for transportation. Usually, the punctuality of the transport, the effectiveness of the terminals and the functioning of the border stations are more important. The effects of speed on safety are well known. According to the Swedish so-called power model, the change in fatal and severe injury accidents is proportional to the third power of speed change and the change in fatal accidents is proportional to the fourth power of speed change. In the next years, the most essential main roads will be selected to form a trunk road network. The purpose of this network is to help achieve a high and consistent level of quality as well as a rather high and steady speed level. In a survey made by Liikenneturva in 2006, almost half of the respondents said they were afraid of speeding motorists, when given alternative choices concerning their fears in traffic. In the report the speed management methods were classified as follows: information and education, road construction engineering, variable traffic signs, speed enforcement and penalties and measures related to vehicle engineering. All of the most important speed management measures were described from the following points of view: legislation, frequency, expected developments, effects and suitability for different traffic environments. Based on present state analysis and a brainstorming session, a plan for the long-span research and development work was formulated, which can be used to create a cost-effective safety improving speed management strategy for Finland. Nine integrated R&D proposals were suggested containing a workload of about 180 man-months. As for the traffic safety vision and the creation of a speed management strategy, projects related to definition of appropriate speed levels for a wide range of conditions, reducing high risks on main roads and further development of speed enforcement were considered the most urgent proposals.

In the U.S., automated speed enforcement programs are currently operated in only 11 states and in Washington D.C., most of which are located on residential streets and not highways. Moreover, a number of automated speed enforcement programs have been discontinued since 1990. This literature review explores the potential benefits and barriers to implementing automated speed enforcement programs in the U.S. by examining the large body of literature on automated enforcement programs, including red-light and speed programs. It begins with background on the implementation of automated speed enforcement and includes a discussion of research on the potential safety and financial effects of these programs. Next, the legal restrictions to the implementation of automated speed enforcement in the U.S. are outlined. This is followed by a discussion of stakeholder support including potential concerns of citizens, special interest groups, elected officials, and governmental agencies. Then, an evaluation of key program design choices is provided, encompassing issues related to owner or driver liability, manned or unmanned systems, mobile or fixed systems, visibility, location, enforcement thresholds, program management, and revenue distribution.

From this research base, it was possible to define a suitable speed enforcement method for  each part of the WA road system and calculate the road trauma reductions  and economic benefits if operated at each level.  The package is estimated to provide a saving of at least $186 million in social costs per annum.   The total cost to produce these savings is estimated to be $18.6 million per annum.  Thus the benefit-cost ratio of the package is estimated to be at least 10.

790247,01034027,Traffic Conflict Studies Before and After Introduction of Red-Light Running Photo Enforcement in Maine,,DO,English,,,https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/38752,,,,,"Red-light running is a major safety concern in Maine.  It can probably best be reduced by enforcement.  This pilot study uses crash data, traffic conflict data, video and field observations of behavior to evaluate the potential effectiveness of photo enforcement in Lewiston and Auburn in Maine.  The intent of the pilot study was to demonstrate the need for photo enforcement, to show that it can work in Maine, and to help the legislators make informed, educated decisions on legislation affecting this program, which may include a shift in policy to allow photo-enforcement activities.  The ultimate purpose of the activity is to improve safety at intersections, thereby reducing fatalities and injuries.  Five signalized intersections in Lewiston-Auburn were outfitted with photographic equipment in the pilot study, which was funded by the Federal Highway Administration, Maine Department of Transportation and the Androscoggin Transportation Resource Center.  The equipment vendor operated and maintained the equipment, and viewed photographic images to insure quality.  The respective Lewiston or Auburn police departments reviewed each potential violation to determine whether a red light violation had occurred, and issued warning letters to the registered vehicle owners of the offending vehicles.  The police were conservative when determining if a red light violation had occurred - likely more violation warning letters could have been issued.  Even with some periods with the systems inoperable and the conservative approach, over 4,600 warning letters were issued during the six-month pilot project, resulting in an average of over 5 violations per day for each intersection, proving that red light running is indeed a major problem.  For a variety of reasons, the system was not operating 100% of the time.  Still, it was shown that automatic enforcement can be used even during Maine's severe winter conditions.  The effectiveness could be further improved with a careful maintenance program.  A system that catches only 50% of all offenders would be about 2000 times more effective than today's enforcement level.  A question that has been addressed through this study is whether automatic enforcement, using video and digital camera technology, effectively can reduce red-light running frequencies even if violations only result in warning letters.  (Maine law currently does not allow issuing citations based on photographic evidence, so only warning letters were issued to violators.)  Observations of red-light running indicate that the violation rate dropped by around 28% between December 2004 (when the system was first installed) and May 2005, when the system had been operational for several months.  But it was the infractions that occurred at low speeds and within the first second or so that were reduced.  Infractions more than 3 seconds into red and at speeds above 35 mph actually increased.  However, it is unlikely that the enforcement system in any way led to this increase in the more serious infractions.  It is possible that weather and roadway conditions explain the higher speeds during the later months.  Future studies should address that.  Conflict and crash data indicate that there were no great improvements in safety between the before period and the period when the system was in operation.  Actual fines rather than warning tickets may have produced greater safety effects.","This research was funded by the U.S. Department of Transportation, University Transportation Centers Program.","NTL, TRIS",Project No. UMER 17-10,,,,,,,,,,DTRS99-G-0001 (Grant),,,,,,,,,,"Automated enforcement, Crashes, Fatalities, Injuries, Intersections, Lewiston-Auburn (Maine), Observations, Photo enforcement, Photographic equipment, Red light running, Signalized intersections, Traffic conflicts, Traffic safety, Traffic signals, Traffic speed, U.S. Federal Highway Administration, Video cameras, Warning letters","Highways, Operations and Traffic Management, Safety and Human Factors, Security and Emergencies, I73: Traffic Control, I83: Accidents and the Human Factor",9/26/2006 1:02:00 PM,3/14/2019 11:33:00 AM,Digital/other,59p,,"Garder, Per Erik",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Figures, Maps, Photos, References, Tables",2006-08-29,,,,,,,,,,,,,"University of Maine, Orono",New England University Transportation Center,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,New England University Transportation Center,,,,,,,,,,,,,Final Report.

Road trauma has also reduced, with current data indicating that the target of 20 per cent fewer fatalities by 2007 will be achieved.  We found no evidence that the speed enforcement program is focused on raising revenue.  Speed cameras are used at sites and times that match identified speed risks and crash histories.  Sound quality assurance has been introduced to minimise errors in detecting speeding motorists, although some aspects can still be improved.  The program is aimed at deterring motorists from speeding both ""anywhere, anytime"" across the road network as well as at specific high risk sites, while demerit points are used to ensure that repeat offenders can lose their right to drive.  Road safety agencies will need to maintain the effectiveness of each of these elements to ensure that the speed enforcement program continues to contribute to improved road safety across Victoria.

The goal of this analysis is to understand the correlation between red light violations and various driver, intersection, and environmental factors. Descriptive statistics suggest that younger drivers under 30 years of age are more likely to run red lights than drivers in other age groups. About 56 percent of the violators were traveling at or below the posted speed limit. Moreover, 94 percent of the violations occurred within 2 seconds after the onset of red light, and only 3 percent of the violations were recorded 5 seconds after the onset of red light. Approximately 4 percent of the violators were repeat offenders. Logistic regression modeling shows that the predicted odds of a younger driver running a red light at speeds greater than the speed limit is about 1.5 times the odds of a middle-aged driver. In addition, older drivers have a higher probability of running a red light when the elapsed time since the onset of red light is more than 2 seconds compared to younger drivers.

The vehicle was traveling in the right lane of a six-lane divided highway. The weather was clear, and the roadway was dry, except for a puddle of water adjacent to a service station on the west side of the roadway. Near milepost 41.4, the Mercedes, traveling 48 to 62 mph, hit the curb on the west side of the road and swerved to the left. The Mercedes crossed the other two southbound lanes; mounted and crossed an 11.5-foot-wide, 6-inch-high raised concrete curb median; and entered the northbound lanes, where it collided head on with a 1986 Ford Taurus traveling in the left northbound lane. The Mercedes rolled up and over the Ford and landed on its roof. The Mercedes slid approximately 80 feet across the northbound lanes and struck a wooden utility pole next to the east side of the roadway, where it came to rest straddling the right northbound lane and the grassy area to the east of the roadway. Following the collision, the Ford remained upright, rotated about 163 degrees counterclockwise, and slid about 50 feet, where it came to rest in the right northbound lane. The Ford was occupied by a 33-year-old driver and four passengers ranging in age from 18 to 31. The drivers of both vehicles and three of the four Ford Taurus passengers died at the scene. The fourth Ford passenger died several hours later in a hospital.

A component of the photo enforcement system is the speed feedback display device that has some effects in reducing the speeds of motorists in work zones.  Data were collected on an interstate highway work zone in three phases and statistical analysis was performed to determine the temporal effect of the speed feedback device.  It was found that the feedback device was effective in reducing average speed by 4.4 mph in a few days after the deployment.  After three weeks of operating the feedback system, the average speed was further reduced by 2.3 mph.  Both these reductions were statistically significant.

EuroRAP 2006 - British results,,DO,English,,,,,,Transport Research Laboratory,ITRD E130272,"This publication considers the safety record of Britain's motorways and trunk roads. There were 2600 fewer fatal and serious injury collisions in 2002-4 than in 1999-2001. Motorways are twice as safe as dual carriageways and five times safer than single carriageways. Most casualties are explained by four collision types: head-on collision, major side impact at junctions, collisions with roadside objects such as trees, and collisions involving pedestrians and cyclists. Collision concentrations can increase markedly where a road runs through a village or the outskirts of a town. Just 8% of the motorway and trunk road network is ranked as high or medium risk. Measures to halve the accident risk on high and medium risk roads would prevent 50 deaths and 300 serious injuries a year. This would result in £300 million savings to the economy and society as a whole, and up to £10 million saved in health service budgets.  Britain's most improved road is a 12km section of the A452 on the outskirts of Birmingham and Wolverhampton (Sutton Coldfield to Brownhills). On this road, speed limits were reduced and more frequent speed enforcement was also implemented, leading to a 73% reduction in fatal and serious collisions.

First, the magnitude of the problem for driver compliance is assessed by a comparison of the 85th percentile speed with the posted speed limit. The second aspect deals with selected speed limits at study sites, and models for estimating these percentiles are suggested. Examining the effect of automated speed enforcement with speed radar cameras and the presence of police cars was the third aspect. A sample of slightly more than 69,000 spot-speed observations was gathered from 41 sites (14 freeways, 22 arterials, and 5 residential streets) during 2003 in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, and in Buraidah, a small city about 300 km north of Riyadh. Analysis showed that the study sites were suffering from a tremendous speed problem. Although the problem could be blamed in part on inappropriate selection of speed limits, the speeding trends disclosed that drivers overall tend to exceed the posted limit by a great amount. The proportions of motorists with 85th percentile speeds over the speed limit are 10%, 88%, and 100% on freeways, arterials, and residential streets, respectively. A primary concern is the relatively high speeds observed on residential streets. Although the speed limit on such streets does not exceed 40 km/h, the observed 85th percentiles were all more than 55 km/h; this highlights the speeding issue on these neighborhood streets, where pedestrian activities are prevalent. The study found that both enforcement methods, namely, speed radar cameras and police car presence, appeared effective and led to a reduction of mean speed by at least 10 km/h.",,"TRIS, TRB",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85th percentile speed, Arterial highways, Automated enforcement, Cameras, Compliance, Driver experience, Freeways, Highway safety, Police operations, Radar, Residential streets, Saudi Arabia, Speed limits, Speeding, Traffic law enforcement","Highways, Planning and Forecasting, Safety and Human Factors, Security and Emergencies, I72: Traffic and Transport Planning",3/3/2006 10:45:00 AM,12/6/2006 11:33:00 AM,Print,pp 1-9,,"Al-Ghamdi, Ali Saeed",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Figures, References, Tables",2006-00-00,Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Transportation Research Board Business Office,Find a library where document is available,,,,,,,,,0309099781,,1969,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

After a descriptive accident analysis, carried out by the provincial government in the late nineties, the 'N8' was selected as one of the most unsafe roads, mainly with regard to speeding violations. By the end of 2002, a comprehensive speed enforcement programme was set up for the N8. The speed enforcement strategy consists of increased police control, installation of automated speed cameras, reduced speed limits and information campaigns. Taking into account accident data of a 12 year pre-period and 3 year after-period, this study shows that the effect of the programme on the number and severity of road accidents, adjusted for the trend and regression-to-the-mean, is significant. The empirical analysis reveals a reduction of 35% for the total number of accidents, 43% for the total number of accidents minus the collisions with parked vehicles, 25% for accidents with material damage only, and 19% for injury accidents.

Estimates are that in about a quarter to one third of fatal crashes excessive speeds are involved, making speed one of the crucial factors in road safety.  Management of speeds of drivers of motorized vehicles has a high safety potential.  Until now this has been done mostly by road design, setting speed limits, and enforcing these limits.  Speed limits should be safe and credible.  Speed enforcement is reported to be effective and cost-beneficial.  Use of modern technologies, such as safety cameras, laser guns, section control, etc. have made speed enforcement more effective and efficient.  In the future, new intelligent vehicle technology will create new possibilities for speed management.  This new technology can operate independent of, or integrated with, police checks.

Gatsometer and Truvelo have also developed digital versions of their fixed-point cameras and Gatsometer is working on a SOD system. All the installed SOD systems in the UK are supplied by Speed Check Services. The use of SOD systems in Nottingham and Strathclyde is outlined. The SOD approach is in growing demand for major roadworks sites.

775097,01018447,Safety and economic impacts of photo radar program,,DO,English,,,,,,Transport Research Laboratory,ITRD E128010,"Unsafe speed is one of the major traffic safety challenges facing motorized nations. In 2003, unsafe speed contributed to 31 percent of all fatal collisions, causing a loss of 13,380 lives in the United States alone. The economic impact of speeding is tremendous. According to NHTSA, the cost of unsafe speed related collisions to the American society exceeds $40 billion per year. In response, automated photo radar speed enforcement programs have been implemented in many countries. This study assesses the economic impacts of a large-scale photo radar program in British Columbia. The knowledge generated from this study could inform policy makers and project managers in making informed decisions with regard to this highly effective and efficient, yet very controversial program. This study establishes speed and safety effects of photo radar programs by summarizing two physical impact investigations in British Columbia. It then conducts a cost-benefit analysis to assess the program's economic impacts. The cost-benefit analysis takes into account both societal and funding agency's perspectives. It includes a comprehensive account of major impacts. It uses willingness to pay principle to value human lives saved and injuries avoided. It incorporates an extended sensitivity analysis to quantify the robustness of base case conclusions. The study reveals an annual net benefit of approximately C$114 million in year 2001 Canadian dollars to British Columbians. The study also finds a net annual saving of over C$38 million for the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia (ICBC) that funded the program. These results are robust under almost all alternative scenarios tested. The only circumstance under which the net benefit of the program turns negative is when the real safety effects were one standard deviation below the estimated values, which is possible but highly unlikely. Automated photo radar traffic safety enforcement can be an effective and efficient means to manage traffic speed, reduce collisions and injuries, and combat the huge resulting economic burden to society. The cost-effectiveness of the program takes on special meaning and urgency when considering the present and future government funding constraints. The application of the program, however, should be planned and implemented with caution. Every effort should be made to focus on and to promote the program on safety improvement grounds. The program can be easily terminated because of political considerations, if the public perceives it as a cash cow to enhance government revenue.

The evaluated speed enforcement project was conducted in the Friesland province, located in the northern part of the Netherlands. Enforcement was mainly done through mobile radar and focused on rural non-motorway roads. Publicity and information supported the enforcement activities. The evaluation study covered a period of 5 years of enforcement. The speed data of these 5 years and the year preceding the enforcement project showed a significant decrease in mean speed and the percentage speed limit violators over time. The largest decrease was observed in the first year of the enforcement project and in the fourth year of the project, when the enforcement effort was further intensified. Researchers found similar decreases in speeding at both the enforced roads and at the nearby comparison roads that were not subjected to the targeted speed enforcement project, which may be explained by spillover effects. The best estimate for the safety effect of the enforcement project is a reduction of 21% in both the number of injury accidents and the number of serious casualties. This was based on comparing the number of accidents/casualties during the enforcement project (5 years) and the eight preceding years on the enforced roads and at all other roads in the rural areas of this province.",,TRIS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Evaluation, Friesland (Netherlands), Highway safety, Radar, Rural highways, Speed cameras, Speed data, Speed limits, Speeding, Traffic crashes, Traffic law enforcement, Traffic speed, Traffic violators","Highways, Safety and Human Factors, Security and Emergencies, I83: Accidents and the Human Factor",12/7/2005 6:23:00 PM,12/3/2008 10:16:00 AM,Print,pp 1135-1144,,"Goldenbeld, Charles","van Schagen, Ingrid",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Figures, References, Tables",2005-11-00,Accident Analysis & Prevention,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Find a library where document is available,,,,,,,,,,,37,6,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

Photo speed enforcement systems (speed cameras) that automatically sense a speeding vehicle and photograph it and its driver have proven effective at reducing speeding violations, primarily on city streets and arterials.  The use of this technology on high-volume, high-speed, multi-lane freeways is technically much more challenging, and largely untested.  This research investigates if the current offerings of vendors can provide a viable technical solution in this freeway environment.  Twelve ideal characteristics were established that are needed for a speed camera system to operate on Phoenix, Arizona, metro-area freeways.  Six vendors were interviewed.  Thirteen agencies that use speed camera systems were interviewed, although none were found with sufficient freeway operating experience to provide definitive information to design a field trial.  Therefore, only a conceptual field trial and accompanying test plan were developed to explore the technical aspects of potential systems.  Public opinion and countermeasures on speed camera systems were researched and reported.  No current vendor offering meets all of the twelve ideal characteristics that were established.  Advancements in speed camera systems continue, and it is logical to predict that they can be met in the future.  One new technology that shows promise is ""point-to-point,"" which tracks average speed between two points on a roadway.

749225,00985408,HOW LIGHT RAIL SYSTEMS HAVE ENHANCED GRADE CROSSING SAFETY,,DO,English,,,,,,UC Berkeley Transportation Library,BTRIS Record Number 5218,"This article offers an overview of grade crossing safety issues for light rail systems. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) is exploring the use of locomotive-mounted cameras to examine highway rail grade crossing safety and trespass prevention. Meanwhile, a number of system operators are already reporting successes, particularly as a result of focusing on the 3 Es of engineering, education, and enforcement. For engineering, some system operators are turning to reconfigured traffic signal lights which allow the lights to turn red for all traffic as trains pass by. Others are installing experimental four-quadrant railroad crossing gates, installed medians designed to prevent cars from driving around gates when down, and pedestrian gates behind sidewalks, in an effort to minimize train collisions.

Questions have been raised regarding the contracting, design, implementation, operation of red light camera systems, and the legality and intent of photo enforcement systems.  In a broader perspective, for continued use of red light camera systems and other technologies to improve transportation operations and safety, it is vital these technologies are perceived as accurate and reliable and are applied fairly.  Red light cameras are currently in place in more than 95 communities in the United States.  As red light camera programs continue to be implemented across the nation, there is much to be learned from previous experiences.  Traffic engineers, law enforcement officials, and other State and local agency managers can benefit greatly from guidance and research that provides effective and comprehensive procedures for implementing a successful red light camera program.  The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) have developed these operational guidelines for use by State and local agencies for the implementation and operation of red light camera systems. Although not a regulatory requirement, the guidelines are intended to provide critical information for State and local agencies on the relevant aspects of red light camera systems in order to promote consistency, proper implementation, and operation; and to ensure that this effective tool and other forms of technology remain available to transportation and enforcement agencies around the nation.  These guidelines can be used by State and local agency managers, transportation engineers, and law enforcement officials to identify and properly address safety problems resulting from red light running within their jurisdictions.

This is required to prioritise and guide the implementation of speed management related road safety or enforcement initiatives; to help separate the impact of specific initiatives from that of wider policies or trends, so as to assess their effectiveness; and to establish the extent to which specific localised initiatives have only a local or a more widespread impact on driver behaviour. The resulting speed monitoring system captures data from a total of 120 representatively located speed monitoring sites, at which inductive loop detectors are used to monitor individual vehicle speeds. Data acquisition is on a rotating basis, typically over two week periods once every three months or so, with the resulting speed data being interrogated and analysed within a bespoke geographical information system, linked to cartographic based displays of speed limits, road accident data and speed enforcement activity. The GIS is constructed within a PC based ARC/View environment, which is both portable and adaptable, ideal for empirical studies. The speed monitoring sites have been selected to give a representative coverage of geography, road environments, speed limits and traffic levels across the whole County.The paper will then indicate how the resulting speed data is analysed and displayed within the bespoke GIS, utilising enhanced cartographic displays based displays to provide a comprehensive appreciation of the interactions between road safety management and speed enforcement activities and their apparent impacts on traffic speeds and on road accidents.

The length of the road section under surveillance was 42.5 km between the cities of Kirkkonummi and Karjaa in Southern Finland. The before-and-after study consisted of spot speed measurements using inductive loops and travel speed measurements using the license plate method. Spot speed measurements were conducted during summer (100 kph) and winter (80 kph) speed limits. Travel speeds were measured only in summer. The study did not consider how effectively the enforcement was conducted. The mean spot speeds decreased at all six measurement points by 1.5-4.4 kph (speed limit 100 kph) immediately after automatic enforcement was introduced. The effect was almost the same a year after the beginning of enforcement (the speeds decreased by 1.1-3.5 kph). All six measurement points showed a similar result also during winter speed limits (the speeds decreased by 1.5-4.9 kph). As a control, speed data from five other measurement points outside the surveillance road section were collected. They did not show the decrease in mean spot speeds. Speed limit excesses of more than 20 kph halved at all surveillance-area measurement spots immediately after automatic enforcement. Again, the effect was almost the same a year after the beginning of enforcement. Correspondingly, speed limit excesses of 11-20 kph decreased at least by a fourth at every measurement point. Speed limit excesses of more than 20 kph during wintertime halved at three measurement points, and at three others decreased by at least by a third. Also during wintertime the proportion of speed limit excesses of 11-20 kph decreased at least by a fourth at every measurement point. However, the proportion of these remained at 10-20% after enforcement during wintertime.ûThe mean travel speed decreased by 2.1 kph in the direction of Kirkkonummi but not in the direction of Karjaa. However, the standard deviation of speed was also reduced in the direction of Karjaa. The number of overtakings halved in both directions.

This paper argues that whilst there is no need to explain to the police and the public why police enforce to prevent crime, there is a need to explain the rationale behind the road policing enforcement programme, especially the issue of speed enforcement.

The survey shows continuing high acceptance of speeding as the main cause of casualty crashes.  There also continues to be substantial support for general countermeasures to reduce speeding, particularly general police enforcement.  Increasing the level of advertising campaigns and increasing the use of fixed speed cameras, meet with less support though it is still relatively high.  Countermeasures that will impact more intrusively on drivers meet with the least support.  The survey showed that a key attitude to address is 'not wanting to break the law' as a motivator for driving speed.  The cues and situations that lead drivers to speed — such as being in a hurry, the risk of detection, the 'roll on' effect of the speed of other drivers, and light traffic — must also be taken into account in understanding the decision making process.  There is a need to establish stronger social norms against speeding, learning from experience especially in the area of drink driving in which the behaviour is strongly seen as socially undesirable.",Printed volume (S 656.08 ROA (2005)) contains peer-reviewed papers.

Different jurisdictions have run camera programs with different levels of intensity, and increased the intensity by differing amounts over time, creating a 'natural experiment' which it was hoped would give insights into the relationship between the extent of camera programs and vehicle speeds.  Police in the different jurisdictions provided operational statistics on camera hours, numbers of vehicles checked, numbers of vehicles exceeding prosecution threshold and number of Traffic Infringement Notices (TINs) issued for the period July 1998-July 2003.  Analysis is limited to a consideration of the descriptive statistics.  The key findings of the study were that the average number of camera speed checks per vehicle per year is between ten and sixteen, depending upon jurisdiction, that the level of offences appeared to stabilise when the camera programs are consistent and that major changes in programs were required to produce changes in speed behaviour.  It is proposed that habitual speed choice is determined by a 'comfort level', a state of equilibrium which balances influences which tend to lower speed, particularly enforcement, against influences which will tend to maintain existing speeds, such as the inconvenience of changing established driving patterns.",Printed volume (S 656.08 ROA (2005)) contains peer-reviewed papers.

The purpose of this legislation was to reduce the incidence and severity of crashes involving unprotected road users.  The effectiveness of the initiative has been evaluated under a quasi-experimental design framework at various intervals with the last covering a period of almost three years.  The first evaluation, covering the first five months of the initiative, showed that the program was associated with statistically significant reductions for all casualty crashes.  Results of the second evaluation were unable to show continuing crash reductions for the six to seventeen month post implementation period.  Closer inspection of the data suggested that this was not necessarily an indication that the 50 km/h speed limit was no longer effective in reducing crashes, but an issue relating to the study design used.  Specifically, it was believed that contamination of the comparison group (as defined by the study design) had occurred due to the introduction of a number of new speed enforcement initiatives.  To overcome this issue, an alternative methodology was devised and applied to data covering a 35-month post implementation period allowing the effects of the 50 km/h speed limits to be estimated separately.

Estimates vary as to the extent of the objections to their use, but it is undeniable that the policy has been controversial and that the authorities have had to devote considerable amounts of effort to justifying this road safety intervention.  Although commonly acknowledged, these objections have remained unexplored.  Opinion polls demonstrate levels of support and opposition without attempting to understand and dissect the specific objections of those who oppose the use of cameras.  Focus groups of drivers and Internet discussion forums have been used to look beyond the simple 'for' and 'against' dichotomy and have identified that notions of justice and fairness lie at the heart of many concerns with the use of speed cameras.  This paper will consider how the technology of the speed camera itself contributes to perceptions that the system of enforcement is unfair in a variety of different ways, and will offer some suggestions as to how the policy could be developed to address some of these concerns, and consequently be rendered more generally acceptable to the general public who experience it.",Printed volume (S 656.08 ROA (2005)) contains peer-reviewed papers.

744742,00981975,REDUCING INJURY FROM SPEED RELATED ROAD CRASHES,,DO,English,,,,,,,,"Decreasing vehicle travel speeds has been proven to reduce stopping distances and impact speed, thus reducing the incidence of serious casualties and fatalities.  However, there has been little consensus and much controversy over specific speed reduction interventions.  This paper reviews the evidence for a population-based speed reduction strategy, based predominately on the widespread mismatch between existing speed limits and levels of infrastructure safety.  The paper also explores how flawed public policy decision-making by jurisdictions has inflamed public opposition to speed reduction interventions. The author suggests that governments should adopt a short term strategy of reducing travel speeds on roads with insufficient existing system safety.  This could be done by reducing the posted speed limit and enforcing it via automated measures. Governments need to do a better job of explaining the objective of speed enforcement strategies, reducing the temptation to put revenues derived from increased enforcement into the general revenues, and structuring enforcement practice to maximize injury reduction outcomes rather than minimizing public reaction.",,TRIS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Crash causes, Crash injuries, Highway safety, Infrastructure, Policy making, Public opinion, Public policy, Speed limits, Speeding, Traffic law enforcement","Highways, Operations and Traffic Management, Policy, Safety and Human Factors, Society, I83: Accidents and the Human Factor",11/5/2004 12:00:00 AM,11/5/2004 12:00:00 AM,,p. 257-259,,"Johnston, I",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,References,2004-10-00,Injury Prevention,,,,,,,,,,,,BMJ Publishing Group,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,BMJ Publishing Group,Find a library where document is available,,,,,,,,,,10,5,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

The changes in accident frequency attributable to the effect of cameras on both speed and route choice are separately estimated, as are the changes due to general trends in accidents and regression-to-mean: changes that would have occurred with or without a camera. It was found that the average effect of the cameras was a fall in personal injury accidents of some 25%, of which a fall of some 20% was attributable to their impact on speed with a 5% fall due to diversion of traffic away from routes with cameras. Safety improvements were observed over a distance of up to 1km upstream and downstream of the cameras, with no evidence that any sudden changes in speed on approaching or passing the cameras had any detrimental effect on safety. The impact of the cameras on fatal and serious accidents was rather less certain and served to highlight the dangers of ignoring regression-to-mean effects. While reductions of the order of one third were observed, more than half of this was attributable to regression-to-mean. It is argued that the current guidelines for locating cameras, and the criteria for judging their success or failure, place too much emphasis on observed numbers of fatal and serious accidents: without proper controls for regression-to-mean some roads which might benefit from increased speed enforcement may not qualify for a camera while cameras which are actually improving road safety may be judged unsuccessful.

In order to assess public response to these initiatives, a baseline telephone survey, was conducted in order to record related attitudes and behaviours under the speed camera program.  Since then several new speed camera technologies have been introduced, the number of camera hours per month has also been increased, and both the speed camera tolerance and  the residential speed limit have been lowered.  A revised survey to address these changes was conducted in Melbourne in October 2002, with quotas specified to match the demographics of the 1999 sample.  The aim was both to ascertain any changes in self-reported attitudes and behaviours in the period following the introduction of the new initiatives and assess specific perceptions of these new initiatives with additional items.  Respondents reported greater awareness of speed enforcement in general and of speed cameras in particular in 2002. Overall the innovative efforts of Victoria  Police and the changes in speed camera technology are appearing to be effective in changing people's attitudes towards speeding and self-reported speeding behaviour.

The length of the road section under surveillance was 42.5 km between the cities of Kirkkonummi and Karjaa in Southern Finland. The before-and-after study consisted of spot speed measurements using inductive loops and travel speed measurements using the license plate method. Spot speed measurements were conducted during summer (100 km/h) and winter (80 km/h) speed limits. Travel speeds were measured only in summer. The study did not consider how effectively the enforcement was conducted. The mean spot speeds decreased at all six measurement points by 1.5-4.4 km/h (speed limit 100 km/h) immediately after automatic enforcement was introduced. The effect was almost the same a year after the beginning of enforcement (the speeds decreased by 1.1-3.5 km/h). All six measurement points showed a similar result also during winter speed limits (the speeds decreased by 1.5-4.9 km/h). As a control, speed data from five other measurement points outside the surveillance road section were collected. They did not show the decrease in mean spot speeds. Speed limit exceedings over 20 km/h halved at all surveillance area measurement spots immediately after automatic enforcement. Again, the effect was almost the same a year after the beginning of enforcement. Correspondingly, speed limit exceedings of 11-20 km/h decreased at least by a fourth at every measurement point. Speed limit exceedings over 20 km/h during wintertime halved at three measurement points and at three others decreased at least by a third. Also the wintertime proportion of speed limit exceedings of 11-20 km/h decreased at least by a quarter at every measurement point. However, the proportion of these exceedings remained at 10-20% after enforcement during wintertime. The mean travel speed decreased by 2.1 km/h in the direction of Kirkkonummi but not in the direction of Karjaa. However, the standard deviation of speed reduced in the direction of Karjaa. The number of overtakings halved in both directions.

Six full-time positions were approved to implement the School Safety Program, and several new programs were adopted such as Photo Speed Enforcement at Schools, Red-Light Cameras at selected schools, and enhanced crossing guard training along with improved retro-reflective safety vests and hats worn by the guards. Several experimental traffic control devices were also tested and evaluated as a part of this program. In three years, the School Safety Team has worked with hundreds of schools to conduct crossing audits and parking lot audits, and we have completed 30 ""Safest Route to School"" walking plans for schools.

The present paper considers these issues and draws to some extent on exploratory work done for the Australian State Governments of Victoria and Western Australia. The practical issues involved in a possible reintroduction of front number plates to Victoria are reviewed and the likely time horizons for electronic identification are considered. Extensive public consultation was undertaken, and highlighted the interdependencies of motorcycle design, type approval, police and legal practice.

847017,01087452,Behaviour and Safety Effects of Speed Enforcement with Mobile Radar: A Field Experiment on Rural Roads in the Dutch Province of Friesland,,DO,English,,,,,,Transport Research Laboratory,ITRD E136215,"This paper describes the evaluation of one of the first region-wide enforcement projects, a pilot-project in the province of Friesland which started in 1998 and which preceded the large scale national programme which was to follow. The evaluation study covered a five year period of intensified speed enforcement along 28 above-average dangerous road stretches of the rural network with mainly unobtrusive mobile radar equipment. In co-operation with the Dutch Bureau of Traffic Enforcement, SWOV Institute for Road Safety Research carried out the present evaluation. In the first three years of the project an annual average of about 4500 effective control hours was sufficient to bring down substantially the level of speed offenders on the checked road segments. Statistical analysis could not detect a significant differences between decrease in speeding on enforced and non-enforced 80 km/h roads. Despite this lack of hard evidence, there are indications that suggest that enforcement indeed has made a difference. First, the decreasing trend in speeding in absolute numbers was larger on 80 km/h than on non-enforced 80 km/h roads. The fact that there was also a decreasing trend on non-enforced roads may have to do with a spill-over of enforcement. Since both on enforced and non-enforced roads the decreasing trend started in 1998, the first year of the enforcement programme, such an spill-over effects seems likely. Second, the general decreasing trend in speeding which started in 1998 cannot likely be explained by any other factor than enforcement. In the year 1998 there was not a large scale provincial road safety programme focused on roads outside urban areas, and there was not a drastic changes in mobility in. What we know from the psychology of drivers is that they do not """"spontaneously"""" turn into safe drivers without any change in the road environment. If police enforcement did not play a substantial role in reducing speeds on the roads in Friesland, we are at a loss to suggest an alternative explanation. Based on the available data, the best possible estimate of the 5-year traffic safety effect of the enforcement programme has been a 21% reduction of serious casualties and a 21% reduction of injury accidents as a result of crashes with motorised traffic.nts translates into the extra saving of about 35 serious casualties and 50 injury accidents. Due to the limited number of fatalities we did not perform any separate analysis on reduction of fatalities. However, with an estimated reduction of 35 serious casualties, it seems highly likely that between 3-5 fatalities have been saved.

This pre-study will address mainly the safety benefits expected to be achieved by means of enforcement of speeding, drink-driving, non-use of safety devices and violation of traffic signals. Concerning automated surveillance equipment, the focus is on speeding, close-following and overtaking violations. In-vehicle enforcement and monitoring systems such as speed limiters and other vehicle control and driver assistance system are beyond the scope of this study. The calculations carried out suggest that by developing and intensifying the use of speed cameras, there is a potential for decreasing road traffic fatalities from 37 to 64. Intensifying the use of safety belts and enforcement of drink-driving could each drop the incidence by over 10 fatalities annually. Two scenarios were drawn up concerning enforcement measures needed to decrease the incidence by 50 and 25 fatalities annually. The use of machine vision and wireless data transmission is becoming more widespread among technical surveillance equipment. Manufacturers provide a solution for practically all conventional enforcement needs such as enforcement of red light violations, speed enforcement, turning violations, use of bus lanes and monitoring of stolen vehicles by means of automatic license plate identification. Automatic fixed installations are appropriate for speed enforcement on the main road network. It is advisable to use image pattern recognition in speed enforcement, and the monitoring sites need to have close enough spacing. The computer should be able to transmit the recorded speed violation data automatically to the office system. The price of the portable speed surveillance equipment is about the same as the cost of one fixed surveillance line (10 poles and 1 camera). It needs to be manned, but it makes more versatile enforcement possible, since the unit frees human resources to other enforcement, and the location of portable units can be selected quite freely. The recording of violations and the notification of violations should be automated as far as possible.

772186,01015296,Intelligent speed adaptation in Finland,Alykkaan nopeudensaatelyn kehitys Suomessa,DO,Finnish,,,http://www.mintc.fi,,,TRL,ITRD E213343,"The present state of Intelligent Speed Adaptation (ISA) was examined in this study. A Delphi study to forecast future scenarios and a field trial with a recording ISA for assessing possible traffic safety effects and user acceptance were implemented as well. Results of the studies conducted in different countries illustrate the remarkable traffic safety benefits of ISA systems. Also the user acceptance in trials has been high. The result of the Delphi study is in line with these findings. The experts on the Delphi panel suggested that the safety effect of mobile speed enforcement is almost as significant as compulsory ISA. Because of the significant traffic safety effects and the most profitable benefit-cost ratio, the dynamic mandatory ISA is recommended to be set as a long-term objective in Finland too. The objective could be reached through certain milestones. In the intermediate phase the Recording ISA and the Warning ISA could perform complementarily to each other on a voluntary basis. The Recording ISA could be focused on companies and communities as a quality control system, while the Warning ISA is well suited for private cars. Mobile speed enforcement complements this intermediate phase, focusing on those who are not willing to adopt voluntary systems. Proceeding through several stages and on a voluntary basis enables the international progress of ISA systems to be adopted in Finland. An important milestone could be if the car industry accepted the idea of ISA into Intelligent Vehicle plans. As standard equipment of new cars the ISA would be affordable and other telematic services could be integrated into the system. As standard equipment the ISA should be implemented in a way that allows various Member States to choose the configuration of the ISA.

The study was concentrated on applications with which there was little earlier experience in Finland and applications with which there was a need for further information. The first part of the work was to collect material related to the costs and benefits of different ITS applications. On the basis of the material, the steering group of the project chose ten applications for further analysis. The impacts, benefits and costs of the selected applications were evaluated in the Finnish context. The applications were evaluated according to the Finnish guidelines for the evaluation of ITS projects. Cost benefit analysis was the tool in evaluating the economic feasibility of the applications discussed in the report. It was evident that all impacts can not be easily taken into account in the cost benefit analysis. For example, there is no widely agreed manner to include the improved quality of public transport in the cost benefit analysis. Neither does the cost benefit ratio answer the question, how an ITS project affects the whole transport network. The applications with no previous experience in Finland like ramp metering, E-Call and automatic bus-lane enforcement seem to be worth piloting in Finland. The extension of automatic speed enforcement looks economically justified with both proposed versions of related legislation. Demand-responsive public transport should be implemented in many areas. Network level adaptive traffic signal control seems to be economically feasible only in the biggest cities in Finland. Public transport signal priority and real-time passenger information system should be implemented together using the same components for both systems. Travel time displays are most suitable for places with frequent congestion problems. The future of RDS-TMC depends mostly on the market development for in-car equipment.

VOLUME II - FINDINGS REPORT,,DO,English,,,/common/images/covers/large/678438.png,https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/1719,,National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,,"This report represents findings from a survey on speeding and unsafe driving attitudes and behaviors. The data come from a pair of studies undertaken by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to better understand drivers' behaviors and attitudes regarding speeding, unsafe driving, distracted and drowsy driving. This report, Volume II: Findings Speeding and Unsafe Driving presents the data on American drivers' reported behaviors and attitudes surrounding speeding and other unsafe and aggressive driving behaviors. Volume I: Findings National Survey of Distracted and Drowsy Driving reports respondent's behaviors and attitudes on various topics related to distracted and drowsy driving, while Volume III: Methods Report describes the methods used to conduct the interviews and analyze the data, and also contains the questionnaires. The data come from two surveys each conducted among nationally representative samples of drivers during the Spring of 2002. Interviews were conducted with a total of 4,010 drivers in the U.S. The survey findings show that speeding is a pervasive behavior with most drivers driving over the posted speed within the past month. Drivers are most likely to speed on non-interstate multi-lane roads. Younger and male drivers are most likely to speed. Drivers seem to believe that they can drive about 7-8 MPH over the posted speed before they will be ticketed. While most drivers speed at least occasionally, most also feel the speed limits on different road types are ""about right."" However, about 20% feel the limits are too low on non-interstate multi-lane roads and 35% say the limits on multi-lane interstates are too low. Drivers see the average ""ideal"" speed limit for interstate highways at around 67 MPH, though half feel the limit should be 70 MPH or higher. Nearly four in ten drivers say they would still continue to drive over the posted speed limit if the limit on interstates was raised by 10 MPH. The majority of drivers (58%) feel that someone driving at least 10 MPH over the posted limit would be at least somewhat more likely than a driver at the limit to have a crash. Two-thirds (68%) of drivers feel that other drivers' speeding is a major threat to their own personal safety. While speeding behavior is pervasive, drivers report lower levels of other unsafe driving behaviors such as entering an intersection as the light turns from yellow to red (51% at least sometimes) and rolling stops at stop signs (42%). Fewer than one in ten drivers report other risky driving behaviors such as tailgating, making illegal U-turns, driving through stop signs without slowing, drunk driving, running red lights, and racing other vehicles. However, at least one in six drivers reports ""normally"" encountering tailgating, weaving in and out of traffic, and cars running red lights. Many drivers feel that enforcement of non-speeding unsafe behaviors is too lax, with half or more seeing too little enforcement of tailgating, weaving and running red lights.

Most automated enforcement is directed at red light running and speeding. In red light enforcement, a camera takes two photographs, usually, first when the vehicle crosses a pre-designated stop line and a second when the vehicle is in the intersection.  Some cameras can capture the driver; all capture the license plate. The photo is date stamped, along with the location, the speed of the vehicle (if it's speed enforcement) and, if it's red light enforcement, the length of time from which the light turned red. Arizona has no state laws, though two cities use red light and speed cameras. California uses cameras for red lights and illegal rail crossings. Delaware, Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, Ohio and Washington use them only for red lights. The District of Columbia uses them for moving violations. Utah uses them for speeding in certain areas, around schools and where the posted speed is 30 mph or less. New York allows cities of 1 million or more to use them on up to 50 intersections per city; Oregon allows cities with more than 30,000 to use it, though under 300,000 population, they are limited to four intersections each. Larger ones are limited to eight. Virginia has an automatic repeal in 2005, and Washington has four pilot projects.

The other objectives of this research included:  learning drivers' opinions on the problem, studying the effectiveness of selected countermeasures, and studying the legal issues related to photo-enforcement.  A crash statistics study, telephone survey, and extended monitoring of a selected intersection were the three major approaches chosen to estimate the magnitude of the problem.

The telephone survey showed that 67% of Indiana drivers felt that RLR was a problem in the state.  12% of them claimed to have been involved in a RLR crash.  The extended monitoring of the through movements at the study intersection also recorded a considerable violation rate.  These results indicate that RLR may be considered a problem in Indiana.  Traffic at a selected intersection in West Lafayette, Indiana, was videotaped and the video material was used to detect the red light violations.  The expected number of drivers arriving at the start of the red signal has been proposed as a true measure of exposure to RLR. The authors call it an opportunity for RLR.  This exposure was used to estimate the RLR rate.  The statistical significance of the difference in the RLR rates between different periods was estimated using binomial distribution.  Police enforcement was evaluated and found to reduce the violation rate by approximately 75% in the week immediately after the enforcement. A reduction of 37% was observed after another two weeks.  The photo-enforcement reduced the violation rate by 62% during the week of enforcement and by 35% during the week immediately following.

Automated enforcement (speed cameras) is seen as an effective measure, which is also widely accepted among citizens. However, police resources and current legislation make it very hard to increase the efficiency of automated enforcement. As a part of LINTU - a long-term research and development programme for road safety - a study financed by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and Finnish Road Administration was carried out to evaluate the amount of police work required in two different legislative systems. The study consisted of a literature review and expert interviews. It has been evaluated that to improve the efficiency of automated enforcement owner responsibility has to be introduced. Owner responsibility can be arranged in two different ways: either by administrative payment or by conditional fine. Administrative payment means a system where low excess speeds (for instance < 20 km/h) would be decriminalized. Speeds above the threshold would still be regarded as a criminal offence and would be handled by the police. Administrative payment is sent to the owner or the holder of the vehicle regardless of who actually was the driver during the incident. If the owner or the holder does not want to pay the administrative payment he/she has the right to appeal to a court. The conditional fine is also sent to the holder of the vehicle who must oppose the fine if he/she does not want to pay. If the fine is protested the police will carry out a preliminary investigation. Both legislative alternatives would decrease the time spent in handling the fines in the office after monitoring the speeding. Administrative payment will decrease the amount of police work more than the conditional fine since preliminary investigation is not performed. Since the police resources are likely to remain at the current level there have been opinions about regional speed control. A city, region or road authority could handle some - or all - tasks in the automatic speed enforcement process. Administrative payment allows more regional participation than the conditional fine. According to this study, further investigation is needed concerning legal matters in municipal speed control. Details of appeal procedures in both legislative systems and the organisational structure of automatic speed control need to be clarified.

Enforcement activity taken into account includes speeding infringements (camera and non-camera), visible speed camera activity, and the introduction of marked State Highway Patrol cars.  The study showed estimated reductions in open road mean speeds of 0.7% and 0.8%, associated with each increase of 10,000 speed camera infringements and 10,000 other speed infringements, respectively.  Higher reductions, of 1.1% and 1.6%, were found in the 85th percentile speeds.  An estimated injury crash reduction of 12% was found to be associated with a 1 km/h reduction in mean open road speed during low alcohol hours.  The authors conclude that New Zealand's enforcement program has been associated with significant reductions in open road speeds and injury crashes.  The effect of enforcement is a function of many factors, including the number of enforcement hours taken to issue tickets, locations on the network where the activity takes place, and the speed thresholds at which tickets may be issued.",,"TRIS, ATRI",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Alcohol use, Cameras, Crash injuries, Crash risk forecasting, Deterrence, Law enforcement, Speed detectors, Speeding, Speeding citations, Traffic citations, Traffic law enforcement","Highways, Safety and Human Factors, Security and Emergencies, I83: Accidents and the Human Factor, I84: Personal Injuries",6/17/2007 9:15:00 AM,6/29/2007 7:37:00 AM,Print,12p,,"Povey, Lynley J","Frith, William J","Keall, Michael D",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Figures, References, Tables",2003-00-00,,Institution of Professional Engineers New Zealand (IPENZ) Transportation Group.

The system uses a beam of laser light to measure a vehicle's speed to within 2 km/hour. Each detected violation results in six digital images of the suspect vehicle. The information from the laser and the images are encrypted and stored on a high-capacity PC-card. Providing six images prevents defendants from alleging that another hidden vehicle is responsible for the speeding. Tests conducted of the system by the Dutch police are discussed. The operating principles of the system are described. The system has been given type-approval by the Swiss and is nearing approval in Italy and the Netherlands.

706097,00975520,NEW SPEED ENFORCEMENT INITIATIVES: CHANGING ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIOUR,,DO,English,,,,,,ARRB,IRRD E210330,"In 1999, new speed enforcement initiatives were planned for introduction in Victoria in following years.  In order to assess public response to these initiatives, a baseline telephone survey was conducted in Melbourne during 1999 in order to record related attitudes and behaviours under the speed camera program in operation at that time.  Since then several new speed camera technologies have been introduced, the number of camera hours per month has also been increased, and both the speed camera tolerance and the residential speed limit have been lowered.  A revised survey to address these changes was conducted in Melbourne in 2002 to ascertain any changes in self-reported attitudes and behaviours in the period following the introduction of the new initiatives.  Overall respondents indicated continuing strong agreement that speed enforcement measures contribute to lowering the road toll.  Preliminary analysis indicates in general that efforts of Victoria Police and the changes in speed camera technology are proving to be effective in changing people's attitudes towards speeding and self-reported speeding behaviour.

706126,00975622,THE IMPACT OF SPEED CAMERAS ON SPEED-RELATED CRASHES OVER TIME,,DO,English,,,,,,ARRB,IRRD E210438,"Since speed cameras were introduced in Queensland in May 1997 there has been a steady increase in the number of speed camera sites and the number of operational hours.  However, infringements have not risen in line with this increase in speed enforcement.  Superficially this data suggests that speed cameras are effective in reducing speeding.  An alternative interpretation is that motorists are reducing their speed at known camera locations, thus avoiding detection, but still speeding at locations where they do not expect to encounter any speed enforcement.  If the infringement to vehicles monitored ratio is a system wide indication of the number of motorists speeding, then a decline in this infringement ratio should be roughly parallelled by a corresponding reduction in speed related crashes.  This paper will analyse infringement data, speed camera deployment data and speed related crash data in order to clarify the effects that speed cameras are having on speeding and crashes.

IN: RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN TRANSPORT ECONOMICS,,DO,English,,,,,,,,"The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the consequences of the government allowing the states to raise the speed limits to 65 mph by using a resource allocation perspective: the chance to drive faster reallocates traffic from side roads to the safer interstate highways, and a higher speed limit allows highway patrols to shift manpower from speed enforcement to other safety activities.  The perspective used in this paper implies that the effects of the speed limit should be measured by its system-wide rather than its local effects.  Upon doing so it is discovered that the death rate death rate decreased following the speed limit increase.","Originally published in Economic Inquiry, XXXV, July, 614-620.",TRIS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"65 mph speed limit, Fatalities, Highways, Law enforcement, Public policy, Resource allocation, Speed limits","Highways, Operations and Traffic Management, Planning and Forecasting, Policy, Safety and Human Factors, Security and Emergencies, I72: Traffic and Transport Planning",1/9/2004 12:00:00 AM,2/2/2004 12:00:00 AM,,7 p.,,"Lave, C","Elias, P",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Figures, References, Tables",2003-00-00,,,,,,,,,,,,,Edward Elgar Publishers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Edward Elgar Publishing, Incorporated",Find a library where document is available,,,,,,,,,1840649119,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Use of TRID, like all other portions of the NAS website, is governed by the NAS website Copyright Policy, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement .

A discrepancy often raised in the debate is that despite an increase in the number of cameras, the overall accident statistics across all roads (i.e. both with and without cameras) have not produced the expected improvements. Research to thoroughly examine the effectiveness of various methods of speed camera enforcement by analysing impacts on driver behaviour and accident statistics, thus allowing conclusions to be drawn about which methods are the most effective, is outlined. The approach adopted aimed to determine the ""sphere of influence"" of speed camera systems, and addressed the question of how they are affecting driver behaviour today, along the routes in question. Digital and video speed cameras were included in the study. The work proposed assesses speed camera effectiveness at each site firstly by measurement of the speeds of a random sample of 200 drivers at key locations around the speed enforcement systems and secondly by analysis of accident data for time-periods of equal length before and after the installation of the cameras.
