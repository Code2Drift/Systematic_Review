This present study extends this investigation to explore the potential influence of MPE deployment efforts on subsequent collision occurrences. Specifically, the research team applied survival analysis techniques to examine the connection between MPE deployment variables and the duration between collisions. K-M survival estimates were employed to assess the survivability of classified groups, categorized based on deployment hours, visits, the ratio of hours to visits, and traffic count. The findings illuminated that the ratio of hours to visits emerged as the most impactful variable in prolonging the time interval between collisions and diminishing the likelihood of collisions. Notably, the anticipated reduction in collision hazards, signifying the occurrence of collisions, exhibited variations ranging from 22% to 52%. The most substantial decreases were observed when deployment occurred in high-traffic locations. These outcomes reinforce the positive impact of deployed MPE hours and visits in extending the duration between consecutive collisions, thus reducing the risk of collision occurrences. © 2023 by the authors."

These numbers could have been reduced if the vehicles had been travelling at more appropriate speed. The most commonly reported factors linked to the severity of accidents and deaths are due to reckless speeding or drivers may drive within the speed limits, but they are not aware of the sudden changes on road condition that could affect their safety and the safety of other road users. In response to the needed speed limit enforcement to save lives, health, and economy, this work presents a system that helps to minimize the speed-related accidents. The system is remotely operated and instantly preventing vehicles from speeding. The traffic management authorities can enforce the optimum safe speed limit whenever and wherever necessary in real time while the vehicles are running on the roads. © 2021 IEEE."

The aims of the present study were to measure the actual maximum velocities attained by a sample of snow sports participants in slow zones, to compare them to the recommended velocity limits and to assess whether their velocities were in any way related to their personal characteristics and to environmental conditions. Data were drawn from a sample of 1023 recreational skiers and snowboarders during the 2021–2022 winter season at four ski resorts located in the Spanish Pyrenees. Maximum velocity measurements were taken by the authors with a radar speed gun whose precision had been previously validated. Bivariate analysis tests were used to compare the influence that personal characteristics and environmental conditions had on the participants’ maximum velocities. Furthermore, a multivariate analysis was performed. The binary logistic regression was used to distinguish the categories of personal and environmental factors that have the highest probabilities of impact on different segments of velocity. As generally accepted, probability values were two-tailed, and values of 0.05 or less were regarded as statistically significant. Participants’ mean measured maximum velocity (±SD) was 51.61 (±16.14) km/h. A vast majority of the participants in this study traveled in slow zones at actual maximum velocities well over the recommended limits. Multivariate analysis showed that modality and both environmental conditions (visibility and snow quality) were highly significant and can be used to explain the chances of an increase in velocity in slow zones. Further research is needed to investigate causal relationships between skiers and snowboarders’ accidents, injuries and disrespect for velocity limits. © 2023 by the authors."

This study utilised two high-resolution digital video cameras, a drone video camera, three-dimensional calibration, 3D motion analysis software, a lactate analyser, a heart rate monitoring system, and a radar speed gun. Meanwhile, the eight kinematic parameters analysed at the approach, plant and jump phases showed that the ball speed decreased significantly in the fatigue condition, compared to the non-fatigue counterpart. There was a significant difference in the jump phase duration, step length and jump height variables for the fatigue and non-fatigue conditions during the jump serve in volleyball. Furthermore, the six kinematic parameters analysed in the maximal shoulder external rotation phase showed that a significant difference in fatigue and non-fatigue conditions was found in the shoulder external rotation and backward trunk tilt parameters. Meanwhile, in the maximum angular velocity phase in the upper limb joint, during the jump serve, it was found that the shoulder internal rotation variable decreases significantly in the fatigue condition, compared to the non-fatigue counterpart.

The radar speed gun was used to measure infield spot speed in a divided 2-way, 4-lane arterial in Baghdad city, Iraq. Currently, no comparable data set exists in Iraq. The outputs of the study provide database for safety requirements to identify the drivers' response time to avoid certain crashes. The results revealed that drivers are different in terms of speed, age, vehicle licenses, under different weather conditions. For instance: the mean speed for young drivers is higher than that of elderly drivers. The mean speed of the truck drivers is lowest by approximately 25% as compared with private-cars and taxi drivers. The mean speed under sunny weather conditions is higher than on rainy days by approximately 8.5%.

ASE and red-light cameras help reduce most crashes, such as fatal crashes, injury crashes, and property damage crashes worldwide. Millions of people die yearly because of car crashes, and many more are severely injured. Due to the high number of fatal and injury crashes, to reduce deaths, many countries across different continents in the world started enforcing ASE and red-light cameras to mitigate the number of crashes. ASE and red-light cameras are enormously effective measures to reduce the totality of crashes. Unfortunately, despite the proven efficacy, many states in the United States and worldwide prohibit using ASE. Some prohibit red-light and speed cameras, such as New Hampshire, South Carolina, Maine, West Virginia, and Texas. Certain states only prohibit red-light cameras, including Montana and South Dakota, and some states do not allow speed cameras, counting Wisconsin and New Jersey. This paper will examine the reasons behind prohibiting automated speed enforcement technology. Additionally, the study will collect and analyze data from the United States, Canada, and Saudi Arabia regarding the amount each country levies for penalties and fines for ASE violations.

To enhance safety, speed limits are often reduced in work zones, aiming to create a steady flow of traffic and safer traffic operations such as merging and flagging. However, this speed reduction can also lead to abrupt speed changes, resulting from sudden braking or acceleration, increasing the risk of crashes. This disruption in speed and flow results increases the likelihood of rear-end crashes. Ensuring driver compliance with the reduced speed limits and traffic flow operations is challenging as work zones may cause frustration and lead to more instances of speeding. Therefore, proactively predicting speeding events in work zones can be crucial for the safety of both workers and road users, as it enables the implementation of speed enforcement measures to maintain and improve driver compliance in advance. In this study, we employ the duration-based prediction framework to forecast speeding occurrences in work zones. The model is used to identify significant predictors of speeding including visibility, number of lanes, posted speed limit, segment length, coefficient of variation in speed, and travel time index. Among these variables, the number of lanes, posted speed limit, and coefficient of variation of speed are positively associated with speeding. On the other hand, visibility, segment length, and travel time index are negatively associated with speeding. Results show the model's predictive accuracy is higher for speeding events with shorter durations between consecutive occurrences. The model predicted speeding within 61% of the actual epoch when speeding events within 5 h of one another were considered for validation. This indicates that the model is more effective for road segments and work zones where speeding occurs more frequently. The prediction framework can be a great asset for agencies to improve work zone safety in real-time by enabling them to proactively implement effective work zone enforcement measures to control speeding and to stay prepared, preventing potential hazards. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"

The crushing process and failure mode of the ball at different speeds are analyzed. When the impact velocity is lower than the critical failure velocity, the quartz glass ball rebounds from the target plate, and the rebounding speed is slightly below the original speed; when the critical speed is exceeded, the sphere exhibits a “compressed fracture zone-surface spalling zone-shear failure zone” failure structure; further increasing the collision velocity, the expansion of the shear failure zone causes the sphere to be fragmented into several “crescent” fragments. At higher impact speeds, the quartz glass ball collapses and spalls at a distance away from the impact end. Furthermore, the discrete element software is utilized to simulate the impact damage process of the sphere. The crushing of the sphere under high-speed collision can be divided into three stages: elastic compression, integral crushing, secondary impact. Before the ball breaks, the Hertz contact theory can describe its impact force well, but the crushing force is much smaller than the theoretical value due to the fracture unloading, and the deviation gradually increases with the increasing impact speed. © 2020, Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of High Pressure Physics.

Recent changes in the Brazilian traffic code, such as the increase of the score limit on the driver qualification and the restrictions on speed enforcement, imposed a new operational scenario. Speeding should increase and, consequently, reflecting more accidents and severity. A proposed model in this work has several equations, correlating road geometry parameters and accident record indexes. This model can be applied as an objective policy tool of physical improvements and speed reduction focusing on accident severity and amount.

This calls for the need to create real time surveillance systems to manage the impending dangers of on-road traffic and to meet the objective of intelligent transport systems (ITS). Nowadays, speed control and monitoring is mostly handled using speed law enforcement measures, such as speed bumps, speed limits, signs, speed guns, road designs, speed cameras and intelligent speed assistance (ISA). Previous surveys have not given enough attention to the application of Global Positioning System (GPS) combined with Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) based ISA systems with respect to their types. To fill this gap, this review aims to study the different development and applications of GPS and GSM based ISA systems with the focus on their types, technology and analysis environment. Although, the development of ISA systems is not recent, the full potentials of using ISA systems are still a persistent pursuit.

These cameras are usually placed in areas with significant crashes related to speeding. However, in many countries, detailed crash data are not available or are of poor quality. This study aims to propose and explore three simple ranking methods for identifying optimal locations for speed enforcement cameras that do not depend on crash records. The first method is based on the Star Rating Scores and the traffic volume data. The second method relies on developing a data-driven model for predicting speeding violation rate (VR) based on road geometry aspects and comparing it with available road segment crash risk. The third method uses a combination of the first two methods. The proposed methods and prediction models were applied to a case study and successfully identified the optimal location for speed enforcement cameras. The developed prediction models suggest that speed limit, junction spacing, and the number of access points per kilometer are the most common variables to estimate speed VRs for both urban and rural roads. Availability of service roads and the number of lanes were variables that affect the speed VR on urban roads only. The proposed methods are considered valuable simple tools for road safety practitioners to effectively prepare speed enforcement plans for different road networks. © National Academy of Sciences."

Violation of road safety regulations and traffic laws is one of major reason to this increasing trend. Existing intelligent transportation systems (ITS) to date are accurately enforcing safe municipal speed limits using enforcement technology solutions. The systems for automated traffic enforcement emerged in the last decade. Automated enforcement technologies provide opportunity to remotely capture images of drivers violating laws. RADAR/LIDAR-based tools are used to determine the speed of vehicles. Choosing the right speed detection technology is an area of significant concern for transportation agencies. This paper presents a comparison review of the use of LIDAR technologies vs. RADAR technologies in traffic enforcement systems. The current trend suggests an inclination toward LIDAR technology because of many advantages, particularly its precise identification of violators; especially, this functionality is being required in case of new travel modes (such e-bikes and e-scooty) emerged in urban areas. However, the objectives and available resources of enforcement programs are key factors that may result in growth in relation to demand for both types of technologies. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature."

The aim of this study was to empirically test the extent to which Safety Tutor led to a reduction in both total and fatal accidents on Italian highways during the period of 2001–2017. To do so, we carried out a generalized difference-in-differences estimation using a unique panel dataset that exploits the heterogeneous accident data within all tolled motorway sectors in a quasi-experimental setting. To deal with the potential endogeneity of the non-random placement of Safety Tutor sites, we utilized an instrumental variable strategy by using the network of motorway sectors managed by ASPI and its controlled concessionaires from 2005 onwards (i.e., when the technology was available) as an instrument to predict Safety Tutor adoption. We found that a 10% increase in Safety Tutor coverage led to an average reduction in total accidents of 3.9%, whereas there is no evidence of a significant causal effect of Safety Tutor in reducing fatal accidents. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd"

However, the effects of SLCs on air quality have not been thoroughly investigated due to the lack of data at sites where both air quality and traffic flow measurements (such as speed and volume) are monitored in close proximity to SLCs. This study aims to quantify the effect of SLCs on air quality and traffic flow parameters on access-controlled highways using linear regression models (LRM) and generalized additive models (GAM). The latter allows the modeling of nonlinear functional relationships between the predictor and outcome variables. We collected experimental data, including traffic flow parameters, weather conditions, and air pollutants (CO, CO2, NO2, SO2, and VOC), on high-volume, high-speed access-controlled highways in the wider metropolitan area of Dammam, Saudi Arabia. Key parameters related to traffic, such as volume, speed, percentage of heavy-duty vehicles (HDV), and percentage of traffic exceeding the speed limit, were used to estimate air pollutant generation from vehicular exhaust emissions near highway locations. Our analysis of the collected data revealed that locations with SLCs showed higher adherence to the speed limit of 120 km/h. The 85th percentile speed at these sites was approximately 114 km/h, which was 11 percent lower than that at the no-camera sites. Additionally, field data demonstrated a significant reduction in CO and SO2 emissions at the camera locations by approximately 23.7 and 20.3 percent, respectively. However, at these locations, the CO2, NO2, and VOC gas concentrations increased slightly, ranging from 1.5 to 4.9 percent. The predictive capabilities of the GAMs for gas emissions were higher than those of the LRMs, except for CO2 emissions. The GAM results identified optimal speed values between 110 km/h and 130 km/h to minimize vehicle emissions. Furthermore, the GAM results indicated that SLC locations had significantly lower concentrations of exhaust gas emissions for CO, SO2, and VOC, but higher levels of CO2 and NO2 gases. Thus, the field data and GAM results were in agreement for all gases except VOC. These findings have implications for shaping environmental transportation policies and guidelines, highlighting the multifaceted impact of SLCs on both traffic behavior and air quality. © 2023 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control"

Despite lower traffic volumes during these times, the rate of fatal and serious injury crashes increased significantly across the United States due to increased speeding on roads with less traffic congestion and lower levels of speed enforcement. This paper uses a mixed effect binomial regression model to investigate the impact of stay-at-home orders on odds of speeding on urban limited access highway segments in Maine and Connecticut. This paper also establishes a link between traffic density and the odds of speeding. For this purpose, hourly speed and volume probe data were collected on limited access highway segments for the U.S. states of Maine and Connecticut to estimate the traffic density. The traffic density was then combined with the roadway geometric characteristics, speed limit, as well as dummy variables denoting the time of the week, time of the day, COVID-19 phases (before, during and after stay-at-home order), and the interactions between them. Density, represented in the model as Level of Service, was found to be associated with the odds of speeding, with better levels of service such as A, or B (low density) resulting in the higher odds that drivers would speed. We also found that narrower shoulder width could result in lower odds of speeding. Furthermore, we found that during the stay-at-home order, the odds of speeding by more than 10, 15, and 20 mph increased respectively by 54%, 71% and 85% in Connecticut, and by 15%, 36%, and 65% in Maine during evening peak hours. Additionally, one year after the onset of the pandemic, during evening peak hours, the odds of speeding greater than 10, 15, and 20 mph were still 35%, 29%, and 19% greater in Connecticut and 35% 35% and 20% greater in Maine compared to before pandemic. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"

However, the open communication channels among various entities, including smart vehicles, roadside infrastructure, and fleet management systems, introduce security and privacy vulnerabilities. To address these concerns, we propose a novel security framework, named blockchain-assisted lightweight authenticated key agreement security framework for smart vehicles-enabled ITS (BASF-ITS), which ensures data protection both during transit and while stored on cloud servers. BASF-ITS employs a combination of efficient cryptographic primitives, including hash functions, XOR operator, ASCON, elliptic curve cryptography, and physical unclonable functions (PUF), to design authenticated key agreement schemes. The inclusion of PUF significantly enhances the system&#x2019;s resistance to physical attacks, preventing tampering attempts. To ensure data integrity when stored on the cloud, our framework incorporates blockchain technology. By leveraging the immutability and decentralization of the blockchain, BASF-ITS effectively safeguards data at rest, providing an additional layer of security. We rigorously analyze the security of BASF-ITS and demonstrate its strong resistance against potential security ass aults, making it a robust and reliable solution for smart vehicle-enabled ITS. In a comparative analysis with contemporary competing schemes, BASF-ITS emerges as a promising approach, offering superior functionality traits, enhanced security features, and reduced computation, communication, and storage costs. Furthermore, we present a practical implementation of BASF-ITS using blockchain technology, showcasing the computational time versus the &#x201C;transactions per block&#x201D; and the &#x201C;number of mined blocks&#x201D;, confirming its efficiency and viability in real-world scenarios. <italic>Note to Practitioners</italic>&#x2014;This article is motivated by designing an efficient, lightweight, and anonymous blockchain-enabled authenticated security framework that can fix the security and privacy concerns in insecure environments for ITS applications, such as automated road speed enforcement, collision avoidance alarm systems, and traffic planning and management, etc. Authenticated key agreement schemes are extensively used to secure communications in the ITS environment. However, the existing state-of-the-art schemes are not efficient in terms of performance, are not resilient against potential security attacks, and do not support anonymity, untraceability, and unlinkability. Therefore, we propose the authenticated security framework to secure communication among the participating entities in the ITS environment. It utilizes efficient cryptographic primitives, such as hash function, XOR-operator, ASCON, elliptic curve cryptography, and PUF. It is shown that the proposed framework can be deployed as a robust tool to address the ITS security problems efficiently. Moreover, the proposed framework is lightweight and efficient and can be easily deployed in various ITS applications and other resource-constrained environments. However, the participating entities, such as vehicles and roadside units, must be PUF-enabled to deploy the proposed framework. IEEE"

This study aimed to evaluate driving speeds in relation to the position of cameras among Iranian taxi drivers. Methods: Speed data were collected from April 2020 to January 2021 via telematics devices (using on-board computer, gyroscope, and GPS) installed on taxis in southern Tehran, Iran. All drivers were males above 20 years of age. Throughout the study, taxi drivers were not changed. Eligible road segments were selected based on: a) not containing any obstacle that would cause speed reduction; b) having ≤5 entry/exit points; c) absence of park and ride or taxi stations; and d) availability of at least 5,000 datapoints. The average speed was compared between the camera- and non-camera zones. Camera zone was defined as the area within 300 meters of the speed cameras. Results: The telematics system included 2,644,846 datapoints gathered from 50 taxis. Two highways’ segments with three lanes in each direction were included: Tehran-Varamin (18 taxis, 18,978 datapoints) and Ghadir (17 taxis, 8,203 datapoints). On both highways, speed was significantly lower in the camera zones (Tehran-Varamin: 84.9 ± 12.2 km/h versus 86.7 ± 13.7 km/h; P = 0.005; Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (KS) P < 0.001/Ghadir: 68.7 ± 13.7 versus 73.1 ± 11.3; P = 0.008; KS P < 0.001), indicating a V-shaped distribution of speed near the position of cameras (Presence of Kangaroo effect). Drivers were more likely to exceed speed limits in the non-camera zones compared to camera zones (Tehran-Varamin: 14.6% versus 8.4%/Ghadir: 23.1% versus 17.3%). This effect of the cameras was consistently observed in a subgroup analysis based on time of day (daytime versus nighttime). Conclusions: Among Iranian taxi drivers in southern Tehran, average speed was significantly lower in the vicinity of speed cameras, suggesting the presence of camera manipulation.

Speed cameras measure the speed of a vehicle either at a single spot or in between or at multiple sites over an enforcement section. Red light cameras automatically photograph vehicles that go through red lights. Speed-on-green/red light cameras can detect both vehicles running red lights and vehicles speeding through intersections. Photo speed enforcement has been shown to reduce average speeds by 1%–15% and the percentage of vehicles traveling above designated speed thresholds by 14%–65%. Speed cameras used at spots reduce all crashes in the vicinity of cameras by 20% and fatal crashes by 51%. Section control is estimated to have an even greater effect—reducing all crashes by 30% and serious/fatal crashes by 56%. Red light cameras lower red light violations by 40%–60%. Red light cameras have been shown to reduce fatal crashes by 17% and injury crashes by 12%–30%.

As a countermeasure against speeding, automated speed enforcement systems (ASES) have been deployed in many countries. However, drivers' awareness of enforcement locations allows themselves to adjust vehicle speeds in the vicinity of the enforcement locations. This enforcement avoidance behavior leads to a criticism of the effectiveness of ASES, in which the system promotes abrupt changes in vehicle speed near enforcement locations, increasing crash risk as a side effect. To address this issue, the section speed enforcement system (SSES), which enforces overspeeding vehicles by their average travel speed over a section, has been devised. In this study, we evaluate traffic speed and safety data that were collected from sections with SSES on Korean expressways. The speed analysis showed that the vehicles reduced their speeds inside the enforcement section, and this reduction in speed variations across vehicles was also noticeable, signifying that the risk of traffic crash should be lower. In view of this, we have performed before and after comparative analysis using the empirical Bayes method with the comparison group. The outcomes estimate 43% reduction in crash occurrence after installation of SSES. Furthermore, turning point analysis confirmed that the reduction in crash occurrence ensued immediately after installation of SSES. © 2020 Jisup Shim et al."

Recent work in security games has shown that deceptive signaling by the defender can convince an attacker to withdraw his attack. For instance, a warning message to commuters indicating speed enforcement is in progress ahead might lead to them driving more slowly, even if it turns out no enforcement is in progress. However, the results of this work are limited by the unrealistic assumption that the attackers will behave with perfect rationality, meaning they always choose an action that gives them the best expected reward. We address the problem of training boundedly rational (human) attackers to comply with signals via repeated interaction with signaling without incurring a loss to the defender, and offer the four following contributions: (i) We learn new decision tree and neural network-based models of attacker compliance with signaling. (ii) Based on these machine learning models of a boundedly rational attacker’s response to signaling, we develop a theory of signaling in the Goldilocks zone, a balance of signaling and deception that increases attacker compliance and improves defender utility. (iii) We present game-theoretic algorithms to solve for signaling schemes based on the learned models of attacker compliance with signaling. (iv) We conduct extensive human subject experiments using an online game. The game simulates the scenario of an inside attacker trying to steal sensitive information from company computers, and results show that our algorithms based on learned models of attacker behavior lead to better attacker compliance and improved defender utility compared to the state-of-the-art algorithm for rational attackers with signaling. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020."

This method relies on the assumption that the variability seen in AGNs is constrained by the speed of light during a flare event and can therefore be used to estimate the size of an emitting region. A limitation of this method is that previously, the Doppler factor was required to be known. In this paper, we derive an extension of the 'standard speed-gun' method for measuring cosmological distances that depends on the maximum intrinsic brightness temperature that a source can reach, rather than the Doppler factor. If the precise value of the intrinsic brightness temperature does not evolve with redshift, and flares are statistically independent, we can in principle improve the errors on measurements of the matter content of the Universe (in a flat Lambda cold dark matter model) statistically. We then explored how well a future observing programme would constrain cosmological parameters. We found that recovering the input cosmology depends critically on the uncertainty of the intrinsic brightness temperature and the number of flares observed.  © 2023 The Author(s) Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Royal Astronomical Society."

Participants were 218 Ethiopian male minibus taxi drivers in Addis Ababa. The study followed a three-step sequential procedures: 1. Development of a new instrument addressing the assumptions of the 'major theorists' model, and validation using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). 2. Exploration of associations between variables in the 'major theorist' model using a Pearson's correlation analysis. 3. Identification of statistically significant predictors of self-reported speeding via linear multiple regression analyses. It was found that self-efficacy to drive fast, weak speed enforcement, social pressure from relatives to drive fast, and behavioural intention to drive fast were significant predictors of self-reported speeding behaviour.

Recently, the government has been gaining attention to employ automated speed enforcement systems for monitoring speeding behavior on major highways. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of an automated speed enforcement system implemented along mountainous road sections in Thailand. Specifically, the study examines whether such system changes driving behavior and attitudes. The study has two thrusts. First, the study conducted the observational before-and-after speed study and performed the statistical analyses to evaluate driving behavior. Second, the study conducted the questionnaire surveys and applied the sequential equation modelling analyses together with the Theory of Planned Behavior concept to evaluate driving attitudes toward speeding and speed enforcement system. The study used the Highway No.118, one of the most hazardous mountainous corridors in Thailand as a case study. The results showed the changes in both driving behavior and attitudes. After implementing automated speed enforcement system. there were significant reductions in speed and the number of violators. Moreover, psychologically, drivers believe that they would increase the opportunity to perform overspeed if there is no speed control. Therefore, this study provides decision-makers better understand the characteristics of driving attitudes and behavior in Thailand and ensures the effectiveness of automated speed enforcement system. © 2020 Int.

Methods Observational studies were conducted in eight randomly selected locations in Shanghai. Descriptive statistics and a Cox proportional hazard (PH) model were used in the analyses. Findings A total of 14 828 NMVs were observed in November 2017. At the free flow sites, the average speed was 22.5 km/hour for ebikes and 13.4 km/hour for bicycles. 95.5% of ebikes run above 15 km/hour, the legal speed limit for NMVs in China and 83.8% above 20 km/hour, the maximum design speed for ebikes. Helmet wearing rate was 13.5% for ebike drivers and 9.4% for passengers. Riders of commercial ebikes were nearly three times more likely to wear a helmet than personal ebikes. 22.4% of ebikes were observed to run a red light. The Cox PH model showed that ebikes (vs bicycles), males (vs females), clear weather (vs cloudy, rainy and snowy), helmet users (vs nonusers) are associated with a higher hazard for running a red light. Conclusion To our knowledge, this study is among the first comprehensive evaluation of road user behaviours for NMVs in China. An effective intervention package including regulating ebike production to national standards, strengthening speed enforcement and passing legislation on mandatory helmet use for ebike users may be able to help. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

Relationships between driving characteristics and safety or emissions have been assessed in multiple studies. However, there is scant information on whether safe driving also reduces emissions and how this relationship changes across urban areas. This study makes use of two similar GPS datasets collected in the metropolitan areas of Toronto and Beijing to conduct a comparative analysis of driving characteristics, speed limit violations, and emissions. Emissions for all trips were computed using the same emission rate database derived from a Portable Emissions Monitoring System (PEMS). We observe that the average speeds in the two cities are close to 25 km/h. In Toronto, the fraction of time spent at speeds over 80 km/h on expressways is 40% higher than in Beijing. We also note a higher level of accelerations in Toronto. The trips in Beijing have approximately 14%, 57%, 14%, and 21% lower emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particle number (PN), respectively. Drivers in Toronto violate speed limits in 93% of their trips for 21% of trip travel time while the numbers for Beijing are 43% and 4%. These differences are not necessarily due to driving behavior, but rather to driving characteristics, which encompass the effects of behavior, road network design, traffic congestion, trip patterns, and speed enforcement. A scenario was evaluated by reconstructing drive-cycles to assess the effects of speed limit enforcement for trips where violations were detected. In Toronto, if obeying the speed limit, the mean trip travel time was estimated to increase by 1.8 min. In contrast, trip emissions of CO2, CO, NOx, and PN were found to decrease, on average, by 5.2%, 19.1%, 5.2%, and 2.9%, respectively. Speed limit enforcement can result in lower emissions, by reducing aggressive accelerations. © 2021 Elsevier B.V."

Camera installation also coincided with rapidly changing traffic safety outcomes throughout the summer after COVID-19 lockdowns and protests against police violence. To find the most appropriate control segments for our analysis, we use k-means clustering to identify the five most similar roadways. Compared with these roadways and other geographic controls, the treated sections of Roosevelt Boulevard experienced decreased crashes, injuries, and fatalities after camera installation. These decreases are on the high end of what is found in the academic literature on speed cameras. The findings for total crashes, traffic injuries, fatalities, and pedestrian injuries are statistically different from zero with a high degree of confidence. Differences in pedestrian fatalities are statistically different from zero with 90% confidence. Based on our findings, we recommend that the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and City of Philadelphia extend and expand the automated speed enforcement pilot. Estimates of the economic benefits of reduced crashes substantially exceed the total fines paid by violators. Despite this positive safety effect, additional treatments will be required to make Roosevelt Boulevard substantially safer.

Results: A multivariate negative binomial regression indicates that before the suspension there were significantly fewer casualties (by 22%) in crashes near cameras compared to crashes farther away.

The traffic enforcement equipment and program were purchased and operated through a Private Finance Initiative (PFI) system from 2010 to 2015. Thus, the main objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of the Mobile Speed Enforcement Cameras (MSECs) operated through PFI in KSA using the safety performance of a major expressway in Madinah Region as a case study. Negative Binomial (NB) regression and observational Empirical Bayes (EB) before-and-after study were performed to develop Crash Modification Factors for all collision combined and the three collision severity levels of Property Damage Only (PDO), Serious Injury (SI), and fatal, using the collision data for six years. The results from both methods agreed in that, after accounting for all other variables, MSECs operating through PFI did not contribute to improved safety performance. Collision frequency of PDO, SI, and all collisions increased with the presence of MSECs, with the greatest effect observed for PDO collisions. For fatal collisions, the NB regression yielded an insignificant effect for MSECs while the EB analysis showed that there was a relatively weak evidence of decreasing fatal collisions with the introduction of MSECs. Although the study’s results are in contrast to most studies in the literature, potential reasons for this finding can be related to the mode of operation of MSECs through PFI. As the main motivation of the private sector is to maximize profit, it is possible that the MSECs are installed at locations with high potential of speed violations instead of high potential for collisions. © 2020, Aracne Editrice.

This poses a significant threat to the safety of both wildlife and drivers. The lack of systematically managed roadkill records poses challenges for nationwide research and comprehensive assessment in South Korea. Since 2018, the Ministry of Environment (MOE), Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport (MOLIT), and National Institute of Ecology (NIE) in South Korea have been implementing roadkill investigations and management. The areas selected for roadkill mitigation measures were determined through hotspot analysis based on nationwide roadkill data collected using the Korean Roadkill Observation System (KROS), an integrated online platform. In this study, the top 50 roadkill hotspots were selected, and appropriate mitigation measures, including wildlife fences, warning signs, and speed enforcement cameras, were implemented. A total of 190.6 km of wildlife fences, 75 warning signs, and 27 speed enforcement cameras were installed. The results of these implementations revealed an average reduction in roadkill incidents of 80.2%. Subsequently, we compared and analyzed roadkill incidents before and after these mitigation measures were implemented. The comparative analysis based on hotspot grades showed that areas with lower grades had relatively lower reductions in roadkill incidents. Moreover, the study showed that the presence of multiple mitigation measures in a single area did not significantly differ from the effects of a single mitigation measure. This research will contribute to an enhanced understanding of roadkill mitigation measures and aid in preventing wildlife accidents on the road. © 2023 by the authors."

The majority of the RTC are attributed to road user behaviours exhibited by the drivers. This study sets out to investigate the road user attitudes and behaviours in Abuja, Nigeria. A total of 1526 questionnaires were distributed, of which 321 questionnaires were completed and returned. The questionnaires tried to understand four major road user behaviours, namely use of seatbelts, drink driving, use of mobile phone while driving, and use of child restraints. The results after analysing the questionnaires showed that the majority of the road users in Abuja showed high non-compliance with the use of seatbelts, either when driving or when being driven. About 64% of the respondents admitted to not using seatbelts. Results from the cross-tabulation process showed that the high non-compliance to seatbelt usage was statistically associated with young, single road users. Around one-third of Abuja road users admitted to drink driving. Road users who were married engaged in more frequent drink driving than road users who were single, and the association was statistically significant. A high percentage of Abuja road users admitted to using mobile phones while driving and 55.8% of the total respondents admitted to not using child restraints while driving. A lack of child restraints was statistically associated more with male road users than female road users. It is recommended that stricter enforcement of road safety laws should be undertaken and that the government should provide road safety agents with the right equipment (e.g., speed guns, breathalyzers) that would aid road safety agents to perform their duties effectively in order to curb the excessive bad road user behaviours in Abuja. © 2021 by the authors.

An MPE program utilizes automated photo radar technology to capture speed limit violators, towards an aim to reduce speeding and thus, improve traffic safety. We propose a binary quadratic program that determines where (by location visit tasks) and when (in shifts) to send enforcement resources (operators and equipment) over a month-long schedule. The aim of this program is to minimize violations of enforcement time halos (and thus, efficiency losses) in attaining traffic-safety focused program goals. We solved this problem using a combined Dantzig-Wolfe and column generation optimization approach, after exploring several different types of commonly-used solution methods. The model is applied to a currently operational MPE program in the City of Edmonton, Canada. Using a five-day enforcement time halo, we find that our model results improve resource utilization by 24% over historical program deployment. The scheduling model is the final step of a larger unified MPE program framework that systematically and efficiently connects high-level urban traffic safety goals down shift-level allocations of highly limited enforcement resources. It provides a data-driven and transparent framework that both contributes to cities’ pursuits of Vision Zero and combatting negative public perceptions of MPE programs. Additionally, the framework can be easily adapted for, and transferred to, other automated traffic enforcement technologies across jurisdictions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"

This study aimed to analyze core muscle fatigue effects on the kinematic parameters change during volleyball jump serve. Methods. The participants were sixteen experienced male volleyball players with average age, height, and body weight of 24.6 ± 1.8 years, 1.85 ± 1.6 m, and 79.5 ± 3.5 kg, respectively. This study utilized two high-resolution video cameras, a drone video, a lactate analyzer, and a radar speed gun. Meanwhile, the eight kinematics parameters analyzed at the approach, plant, and jump phases showed that the ball speed decreased significantly in the fatigue condition compared to the non-fatigue counterpart. Results. There was a significant difference in the jump phase duration, step length, and jump height variables for the fatigue and non-fatigue conditions during the jump serve in volleyball. Furthermore, the six kinematics parameters analyzed in the maximal shoulder external rotation phase showed a significant difference in fatigue and non-fatigue conditions found in the shoulder external rotation and trunk tilt backward parameters. Meanwhile, the maximum angular velocity phase at the upper limb joint during the jump serve showed that the variable shoulder internal rotation decreases significantly in the fatigue condition compared to the non-fatigue counterparts. Also, in the trunk rotation and trunk tilt forward, a significant decrease in the upper limb joint’s maximum angular velocity was observed in the fatigue condition during the volleyball jump serve. Conclusion. Fatigue reduces players’ performances during jump serve in volleyball, leading to slower ball speed and changes in body segment movements. © 2022,Annals of Applied Sport Science.

However, the high-energy consumption and harmful gas emissions are still obstacles to achieving clean production by plasma spraying. Considering that the various process parameters of plasma spraying have great impacts on both on coating performance and environmental impact, this study attempts to improve the greenness of plasma spraying including environmental and mechanical properties, through optimizing the process parameters. Methods: The greenness of plasma spraying means to achieve the balance of reducing environmental impact and improving the mechanical performance of coating. In this work, a Fe-based coating is prepared by plasma spraying on the basis of an L9 (34) orthogonal experiment with various process parameters, i.e., power, powder feeding speed, gun speed, and track pitch. A complete life cycle assessment (LCA) study is conducted to quantify and evaluate the environmental impact of plasma spraying. In addition, the microhardness and porosity of the Fe-based coating are investigated to evaluate the mechanical performance. Finally, grey relational analysis (GRA) is used to realize multiobjective decision-making and improve the greenness of plasma spraying. Results and discussion: LCA results show that electricity contributes most to the environmental impact of plasma spraying. When hydropower is supplied, the environmental impacts can be significantly reduced by 46.65%. Based on the L9 (34) orthogonal experiment and GRA, five optimized plasma spraying schemes are proposed, i.e., microhardness optimality, porosity optimality, environmental optimality, greenness optimality, and enhanced greenness optimality. The verification shows that the enhanced greenness optimality of plasma spraying is improved by 11.83% compared with the greenness optimality. Conclusion: In this study, we propose a method to evaluate and improve the greenness of plasma spraying both in environmental and mechanical performance through the integration of LCA and GRA, which can be adopted to optimize the spraying process parameters in real sustainable production. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

Speed enforcement methods such as automated speed cameras are one of the main solutions to the speeding problem. This study investigates the effectiveness of fixed speed cameras on driver compliance in Qatar. Traffic volumes and speed data for vehicles traveling during off-peak hours were extracted from automated traffic counts (ATCs) for 89 sites along 20 road corridors. The ATCs were categorized based on the existence of a fixed speed camera location within 1000 m of the ATC site. Average vehicle speed and percentage of drivers traveling over the speed limit were obtained to evaluate the driver's compliance with the posted speed limit. The study indicated that the percentage of speeding drivers decreased when posted speed limit increased. The use of fixed speed cameras can reduce the average travel speed by 7 and 15 % within the locations of the fixed camera. The percentage of speeding drivers even with the existence of speed cameras ranged between 4 and 18 %. The effect of fixed speed camera enforcement is limited to roads with a speed limit of 120 km/h. Based on the results, priority should be given to installing fixed speed cameras on lower-speed roads. On higher-speed roads, other methods should be considered. © 2023"

Although several speed measurement techniques exist for road traffic, no known systems are available for maritime traffic. In this paper, we introduce a novel vessel speed enforcement system, based on visual detection and re-identification between two cameras along a waterway. We introduce a newly captured Vessel-reID dataset, containing 2,474 unique vessels. Our vessel detector is based on the Single Shot Multibox Detector and localizes vessels in each camera individually. Our re-identification algorithm, based on the TriNet model, matches vessels between the cameras. In general, vessels are detected over a large range of their in-view trajectory (over 92% and 95%, for Camera 1 and 2, respectively), which makes the re-identification experiments reliable. For re-identification, application specific techniques, i.e. trajectory matching and time filtering, improve our baseline re-identification model (49.5% mAP) with over 20% mAP. In the final evaluation, we show that 77% (Rank-1 score) of the vessels are correctly re-identified in the other camera. This final result presents a feasible score for our novel vessel re-identification application. Moreover, our result could be further improved, as we have tested on new unseen data during other weather conditions. Copyright © 2020 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of cardiorespiratory fatigue on throwing ball velocity related to kinematics motion changes in baseball. Methods: The study samples included 12 male baseball athletes (19.3 ± 2.8 years old, height of 1.71.4 ± 3.1 m, and weight of 64.3 ± 3.6 kg). A descriptive quantitative method approach was used. The instruments included two high-resolution handycams (Sony HXR-MC2500, Japan), a high-speed camera (Fastec Imaging TS5-H, USA), a radar speed gun (Bushnell 101922, Germany), a 3D force platform (The AMTI Optima Series 20210, USA), 14 point manual markers, a motion capture system software (Frame DIAZ IV, Japan), and a heart rate sensor (Polar H10, Finland). Results: The results of this study showed that there were significant differences in the ball velocity (p= 0.042), stride length percentage height (p= 0.041), elbow flexion (p= 0.046), maximum shoulder horizontal adduction (p= 0.041), maximum elbow extension angular velocity (p= 0.035), maximum shoulder internal rotation (p= 0.029), and lateral trunk tilt (p= 0.029) when the pitchers were fatigued. Conclusion: Cardiorespiratory fatigue causes changes in the kinetic harmonization of upper and lower body motion, which results in a decrease in the ball velocity. These results are similar to those in previous studies conducted with the intervention of muscle fatigue during overhead baseball throwing, which causes a decrease in the performance and ball velocity. © 2020 Rusdiana et al."

These included replacement of concrete guard post on median by double row metal beam crash barrier, redevelopment of entry and exit points as per Indian Standards, marking and road studs on each of the traffic lanes and particularly near exit/entry points of auxiliary lanes. The Speed Enforcement Cameras and Close Circuit TV with Variable Message Signs were also installed at every 2 km.

Among all the TCDs, Berlin Speed Cushions (BSCs) seem to be one of the most promising because they reduce speeds but do not affect emergency vehicles. However, previous research on BSCs is limited and lacks some important aspects, such as the analysis of speeds at different distances from the cushion or the investigation of the influence of other context variables. In this study, BSCs of different lengths (2.20 m, 2.70 m, and 3.20 m) were deployed in the City of Bari on three roads belonging to the same area. To overcome the limitations of previous research, speeds were recorded using a laser-speed gun before and after the implementation of BSCs, in different conditions, in order to take into account the effect of the following factors: the time of day, day of the week, and average hourly traffic. An ANOVA analysis was performed, with speed as the dependent variable and the above-reported factors and the test road site (proxy variable for the cushion length) as factors, independently repeated for six distance ranges with respect to the cushion. The results reveal that speed evidently decreases immediately before (down to about 13 km/h) and after the cushion (down to about 12 km/h), time of the day is an important factor (speed decrease is much more evident during the morning than the evening), and the length of the cushion has some influence on speed decrease (the speed decrease is lower for the longest cushion). © 2023 by the authors."

To reduce speeding, it is essential to devise efficient schemes for ubiquitous speed monitoring. Traditional approaches either suffers from using special equipment(e.g., radar speed gun) or special deployment(e.g., position-fixed cameras). In this article, we propose SpeedTalker, a mobile phone-based approach to perform speed detection on automobiles. By leveraging the built-in microphones and camera from the mobile phone, SpeedTalker estimates the automobile speed by passively sensing the acoustic and image signals. We propose an integrated solution to effectively estimate the automobile's speed based on COTS devices, and provide a platform for every pedestrian to help report the speeding event of automobiles. Specifically, we use the time difference of arrivals (TDOA) model based on acoustic signals to figure out the candidate trajectories of automobile, and use the pin-hole model based on image frames to figure out the vertical distance between the user's position and the automobile's trajectory, thus to estimate the unique trajectory. Combined with the time stamp of the trajectory, the automobile speed can be estimated. Besides, we propose a method to effectively mitigate the influence of the movement jitters of mobile phone. We implemented a system prototype for SpeedTalker and estimated the automobile speed with high accuracy. Experiment results show that in the scenario of single automobile, SpeedTalker can achieve an average estimation error of 6.1 percent compared to radar speed guns. In the scenario of multiple automobiles, SpeedTalker can achieve an average estimation error of 9.8 percent, which is acceptable for usage.  © 2002-2012 IEEE."

In the context of traffic policing, the temptation is to emphasize the importance of automated systems of enforcement as these pose an arguably less expensive alternative to using uniformed police. In the context of speed enforcement, automated means of enforcement are a logical way to efficiently distribute resources. However, in other areas of traffic policing, like driver distraction, seatbelt use, random breath testing, the use of uniformed police is essential. Following an overview of empirical research examining traffic enforcement, this article explores theoretical explanations for compliance with the law, focusing on research that has examined the importance of procedural justice. It is suggested that an approach embracing both automated means of enforcement coupled with visible police presence is essential to encourage perceptions of procedural justice and police legitimacy. Further empirical research is needed to model the ideal allocation of funding across automated and non-automatic law enforcement in traffic to maximize public compliance with the law and ultimately reduce crashes. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

To combat such significant safety concerns, a speed limit enforcement system has been adopted widely around the world. This study aims to present an econometric approach that estimates the casual effect of speed enforcement on safety while addressing the endogeneity issue by employing an instrumental variable approach within a maximum simulated likelihood framework. In our study, safety enforcement is represented as the number of speeding tickets issued from the speed camera systems, while safety profile is presented as two dimensions of interest, including total crash risk and crashes by injury severity levels. The proposed econometric model takes the form of a correlated panel random parameters model with speed enforcement endogeneity. In estimating the joint panel model, speed enforcement and crash severity components are modeled by employing Random Parameters Ordered Logit Fractional Split technique, while ‘ is modeled by employing Random Parameters Negative Binomial regression technique. In the current study context, the ‘operational duration of speed camera’ serves as the instrumental variable for controlling the endogeneity between speed enforcement and safety. Further, the analysis is augmented by a detailed policy scenario analysis. The empirical analysis is demonstrated by employing roadway segment-level crash data and speeding tickets data from Queensland, Australia, for the years 2010 through 2013. From the policy analysis, it is found that a stricter speed enforcement for serious level of speeding offenses is likely to have greater safety benefits in reducing crash severity levels. Moreover, a targeted increase in operation duration along with stricter citations for major speeding is likely to have significant safety gain. The outcome of the study will allow the decision-makers to identify a robust resource allocation and speed camera deployment plan. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"

However, the implication of this evidence for changes in speed for a population of drivers has not been explored. Method: An integrated model has been developed to estimate pedestrian fatalities resulting from changes in speed of traffic. The model uses combined relative risks of injury crash rate of drivers and probability of pedestrian fatality resulting from an injury crash. Two approaches have been used—an individual approach using probability distribution of speed, and an aggregate approach, using only mean speed. The application of the model has been demonstrated using four case studies with speed of traffic before and after an intervention. Results: It is found that even small reductions in mean speed translate to large reductions in pedestrian fatalities. The risk contributed by speeding vehicles is highly disproportionate to their share in vehicle population. In a case study from Delhi (India), in which at-grade junction was replaced with a grade-separated junction, 74% of risk of pedestrian fatalities is contributed by less than 5% speeding vehicles (>50km/h). Changes in mean speed is a poor indicator of changes in injury risk if the standard deviation of the distribution also changes significantly. A surprising finding was that large variation in the S-shape of pedestrian fatality risk function has relatively small effects on overall results. Conclusions: A new model has been developed to estimate changes in pedestrian fatalities resulting from changes in traffic speed. The application of the model using four speed-related interventions emphasize that deterrence of a small proportion of drivers using speed enforcement can have large implications for pedestrian safety. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

The proposed system detects and tracks vessels per camera view and employs a re-identification (re-ID) function for linking vessels between the two cameras based on multiple bounding-box images per vessel. Newly detected vessels in one camera (query) are compared to the gallery set of all vessels detected by the other camera. To train and evaluate the proposed detection and re-ID system, a new Vessel-reID dataset is introduced. This extensive dataset has captured a total of 2474 different vessels covered in multiple images, resulting in a total of 136,888 vessel bounding-box images. Multiple CNN detector architectures are evaluated in-depth. The SSD512 detector performs best with respect to its speed (85.0% Recall@95Precision at 20.1 frames per second). For the re-ID of vessels, a large portion of the total trajectory can be covered by the successful detections of the SSD model. The re-ID experiments start with a baseline single-image evaluation obtaining a score of 55.9% Rank-1 (49.7% mAP) for the existing TriNet network, while the available MGN model obtains 68.9% Rank-1 (62.6% mAP). The performance significantly increases with 5.6% Rank-1 (5.7% mAP) for MGN by applying matching with multiple images from a single vessel. When emphasizing more fine details by selecting only the largest bounding-box images, another 2.0% Rank-1 (1.4% mAP) is added. Application-specific optimizations such as travel-time selection and applying a cross-camera matching constraint further enhance the results, leading to a final 88.9% Rank-1 and 83.5% mAP performance. © 2021 by the authors.

This paper will study and examine the effects of implementing ASE and red-light cameras on crash reductions. Different countries impose different penalties, and the level of enforcement varies depending on the government control and legislation. This paper will study countries like the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Saudi Arabia to collect data. However, ASE is known to reduce crashes; there are still several obstacles to overcome. Some issues include the high cost of implementation and the public view of ASE. Some members of society believe that it is a method for governments to generate profit and consider it an invasion of privacy.

Positioning the SFT near the end of the taper caused the speed reductions to be sustained over a greater distance into the work zone compared with when the SFT was positioned near the start of the taper. With the SFT positioned near end of the taper, the average speed was 1.5 mph lower at the end of the taper and 0.8 mph lower 1,350-ft beyond the end of the taper compared with when the SFT was inactive.

Firstly, it enables the classification of roads based on the gradual increase in vehicular traffic over time. Secondly, it facilitates the proposal of traffic engineering solutions that are tailored to the existing road networks. This study aims to assess the overall performance of the primary urban streets within the street network of Najaf city during morning and evening peak hours. The collection of field data involved the use of a video camera for the purpose of determining traffic volume, as well as conducting traffic surveys that entailed measurements of lane count and length.

In the three Pennsylvania work zones analyzed, the proportions of vehicles travelling within the allowable 11 mph tolerance were 63%, 75% and 84%. In contrast, in Indiana, a state with no automated enforcement, the proportions of vehicles travelling within the same 11 mph tolerance were found to be 25% and 50%. Shorter work zones (less than 3 miles) were associated with better compliance than longer work zones. Spatial analysis also found that speeds rebounded within 1–2 miles after leaving the enforcement location. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

Soft measures such as education and informational campaigns are typically not sufficient in keeping most drivers at or below the speed limit. Speed enforcement is much more efficient but unless police is omnipresent or speed cameras are installed “everywhere,” the effect is limited in time and geographical area, or very costly. Hard measures are needed to get full compliance. Those are measures that are supported by legislation, forcing drivers to comply. The most interesting, and the one with the highest potential, is the Speed Governor. With GPS and a computer in the vehicle, the prevailing speed limit can be determined everywhere. The system can also be based on vehicle-based cameras reading speed limit signs. The Speed Governor should make it impossible to drive faster than the speed limit. If everybody always kept the speed limit then the number of fatalities would be reduced by (almost unimaginable) 30%–50%, most in Third World countries. The problem, however, is that it is still theory: neither car industry nor any authorities have mandated it yet. However, a proposal from the European Transport Safety Council (ETSC) to mandate speed limiters on all new vehicles sold in Europe has passed a vote by Members of European Parliament. If approved, the technologies would be mandatory for new (not yet designed) models as of May 2022. However, the system may allow overriding it too easily. Empirical research is highly warranted in order to be able to assess the safety effects of a system that strictly never allows speeding. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved"

Method: A generalized ordered logit model was used to investigate the role of roadway attributes, environmental factors, driver characteristics, and vehicle features in injury severity outcomes for occupants. Five years of single-vehicle rollover crash data for the United States were studied. Results: Results showed that the likelihood of serious and fatal injuries increases in rollover crashes with partial or complete ejection of the occupant, no seat belt use, speeding, higher posted speed limits, roadside and median rollovers, undulating terrain, blacktop road surface, and rural roads. We also found that evening, weekdays, previous driver crash, careless or inattentive driving, driver–passenger engagement, aggressive driving, and vehicle type affect injury severity. The deployment of airbags was associated with fewer serious and fatal injuries. Regional differences were found for injury severity outcomes in rollover crashes. Conclusions: The study provides valuable insight for reducing injury severity in single-vehicle crashes where a rollover occurs. Several proven countermeasures may prevent rollovers or reduce injury severity. These strategies include increasing seatbelt use, posting lower speed limits and installing speed enforcement cameras in high-risk areas, flattening roadside embankments, and promoting in-vehicle stability enhancement systems such as electronic stability control and rollover-activated side curtain airbags. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

This is typically due to both the increased frequency of dangerous crash types and the increased severity of said crash types. Rollover crashes while quite rare are a particularly dangerous crash type among other various crash types. In the case of Namibia, rollover crashes reportedly accounted for 34% of both road related injuries and fatalities in Namibia for 2020. When compared to high-income countries the issue of rollover crash severity in Namibia and like sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries becomes apparent. Therefore, it crucial to understand the contributing factors and their associated effects on rollover crash severities in these countries. This study aims to investigate and identify the significant factors influencing crash severities and their associated impact magnitudes on single-vehicle rollover crashes in Namibia by adopting a mixed logit with heterogeneity in means and variances approach to account for unobserved heterogeneity in the data. Although it is not without its limitations the dataset used in this study includes single-vehicles rollover crash instances from 2014 to 2016 within Namibia and is able to provide unique details for the crash observations including various driver, environmental, roadway, and vehicle characteristics. Results from this study indicate several factors including weekends, open roadways, and minibuses to be significantly increasing the crash severity of single-vehicle rollover crashes. Additionally, results provide a basis for which researchers and policy makers can understand rollover crashes in Namibia and adopt an appropriate approach to address this issue, such as, Safe Systems. Such an approach would include but not be limited to the implementation of roadside features, educational campaigns, speed enforcement, and vehicle standards policy. © 2023 International Association of Traffic and Safety Sciences"

In addition, the practicability of the evaluation method was verified. Some indexes which can reflect the stability of traffic flow were analyzed deeply. The traffic stability indexes were divided into the fundamental indexes and the characteristic indexes. The fundamental indexes represented by traffic flow, velocity and density, were selected as the input indexes. The coefficients of speed standard deviation, the rate of lane changing and the average of the headway, were selected as the output indexes. Then the non-expected indexes were converted to the expected indexes by using linear transformation. The undesired output indexes were converted to the desire output indexes according to linear transformation. Based on EDA method, the model of the traffic safety evaluation on urban expressway was established. The difference of input and output indexes in every evaluation segment were calculated, so the relative safety of multiple evaluation samples could be obtained through the model. Take 10 segments of the Xi'an Ring Expressway including 4 weaving segments as example. The radar speed gun and video methods were used to collect traffic data. The LINGO11.0 software was used to solve this model. The results show that there are 6 segments, which are effective units and the road safety degree is relatively effective, while 4 segments are ineffective units with potential safety hazards. The relative safety degree of road sections A, B, C and J of the ineffective units are 97%, 88%, 98% and 96% respectively. Based on the analysis of the evaluation results, it is proposed that when the input indexes such as traffic flow, velocity or traffic density change such as increasing, the hidden danger of road traffic safety is likely to be magnified and traffic accidents are likely to occur. © 2020, Editorial Department of Journal of Chang'an University (Natural Science Edition).

In bowling, using the upper extremity in the throwing motion is one of the most challenging tasks. In order to generate a precise throw, the numerous anatomical components involved in the overhead throwing motion must be coordinated. Shoulder muscular strength is a key component of excellent bowling, and the strength of various shoulder muscle groups influences bowling speed. Therefore, bowling players must exert strength in their performance. This lacks bone stability and sacrifices stability to increase mobility. OBJECTIVES: To analyse the effects of strengthening the shoulder internal rotators and the muscular energy technique of the shoulder external rotators on bowling speed in fast cricket players. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Participating rapid cricket players from the sports field, aged 18-30 years, were recruited and then randomly allocated into two groups: the strengthening group and the MET group. The strengthening group received muscle strengthening for the shoulder's internal rotators, and the MET group received the muscle energy technique for the external rotators. All the exercise interventions were involved physiotherapist supervision sessions with 12 repetitions and 3 sets 5 days per week up to eight weeks. Range of motion was measured by goniometer instrument, and bowling speed was assessed by speed gun. All outcomes were assessed at baseline, 2nd week, 4th week, and 8th week after the intervention with repeated measures ANOVA. RESULTS: Of the 30 participants evaluated, the mean age, height, weight, and BMI were, respectively, 21.40±2.36 years old, 1.74±0.09m, 71.80±16.77kg, and 23.57±4.20Kg/m2 for the strengthening group and 22.53±1.55 years old, 1.70±0.04m, 62.47±8.02kg, 21.49±2.63Kg/m2 for the MET group. There was a statistically significant difference for all outcomes regarding the measured times between the two intervention groups. However, there was a greater effect size for internal rotation ROM (1.99 in the strengthening group versus 1.42 in the MET group) and bowling speed (1.52 versus 1.39) in the strengthening group. External rotation ROM had a greater effect size in the MET group (1.66 for the MET group and 1.16 for the strengthening group). CONCLUSIONS: The study concludes that a significant improvement in shoulder internal rotators and external rotators' strength leads to improved bowling speed, so the shoulder strength training protocol and muscle energy training can be incorporated for increasing the bowler's speed. © 2022, BAHIANA - School of Medicine and Public Health.

However, the issue of treatment heterogeneity, defined as the variation in treatment effects, has rarely been investigated before. This paper contributes to the literature by introducing generalized random forests (GRF) for estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs) in road safety analysis. GRF has high functional flexibility and is able to search for complex treatment heterogeneity. We first perform a series of simulation experiments to compare GRF with three causal methods that have been used in road safety studies, i.e., outcome regression method, propensity score method, and doubly robust estimation method. The simulation results suggest that GRF is superior to these three methods in terms of model specification, especially with the existence of nonlinearity and nonadditivity. On the other hand, a large dataset is required for accurate GRF estimation. Then we conduct a case study on the UK's speed camera program. Our results indicate significant reductions in the number of road accidents at speed camera sites. And the heterogeneity in treatment effects is found to be statistically significant. We further consider the associations between the baseline accident records, traffic volume, local socio-economic characteristics, and the safety effects of speed cameras. In general, the effect of speed cameras is larger at the sites with more baseline accident records, higher traffic volume, and in more densely-populated and deprived areas. Several policy suggestions are provided based on these findings. The evaluation of HTEs likely offers more comprehensive information to local authorities and policy makers, and improves the performance of speed camera programs. Moreover, GRF can be a promising approach for revealing treatment effect heterogeneity in road safety analysis. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"

Speed enforcement merits special attention as the correlation between exceeding speed limits and the risk of fatalities and serious injuries is well-known. Methods based on radar and light detection and ranging techniques have established themselves as effective methods for measuring vehicle speeds in real time on roads. However, the price of instruments used for these measurements limits their widespread applicability. This work explored the potential of coupling artificial intelligence and audio analysis for vehicle speed assessment. The potential of deep neural networks and extreme gradient boosting is explored on a recently proposed real-world vehicle speed dataset. Frequency analysis techniques are also applied to help reduce the computational demands of experimentation. Additionally, a modified optimization algorithm is introduced to help select optimal control parameters and improve the performance of the suggested method. Five experiments were executed to demonstrate the potential for detecting the exact vehicle speed using regression techniques as well as utilizing classifications to detect vehicles breaking the speed limit.

According to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement guidelines, speeding and its corresponding countermeasures were regarded as keywords. In this study, 11 electronic databases were employed to search for relevant literature regarding the automated speed enforcement system, anti-speeding advertising measure, speeding warning sign, and intelligent speed adaptation system. Literature quality assessment indexes were established to evaluate the searched literature. In total, 101 studies were included in the review. Findings of the studies were synthesized in a narrative analysis. The research results indicate that the automated speed enforcement system, anti-speeding advertising measure, speeding warning sign, and intelligent speed adaptation system have varying anti-speeding effectiveness, which are affected by some road, traffic, and environmental conditions and human factors. Specifically, with regard to the automated speed enforcement system, the point-to-point speed enforcement system outperforms others, whereas the mobile speed camera system follows others; with respect to the anti-speeding advertising measure, outdoor advertisement outperforms other advertising measures, whereas print advertisement has little effect; as for the speeding warning sign, public posting of speeding information has a significant anti-speeding effectiveness; moreover, the warning dynamic speed display sign is superior to the standard one; as for the intelligent speed adaptation system, the compulsory intelligent speed adaptation system performs better than the others; however, the voluntary intelligent speed adaptation system demonstrates the worst performance. Additionally, most combined anti-speeding countermeasures perform better than a single countermeasure. In summary, the automated speed enforcement system outperforms three other anti-speeding measures, followed by the intelligent speed adaptation system, speeding warning sign, and anti-speeding advertising measure. Furthermore, combined countermeasures evidently improve intervention effectiveness. The abovementioned findings provide evidences for the selection and conceivement of anti-speeding countermeasures. Aimed at overcoming the limitations and determining the unclear influence factors of the existing anti-speeding measures, future studies need to optimize experimental and observational schemes to further examine the effectiveness and corresponding influence factors of the anti-speeding measures. Furthermore, additional studies need to be conducted to propose novel anti-speeding countermeasures based on big data (such as vehicle trajectory and video data). © 2020, Editorial Department of China Journal of Highway and Transport.

There is a substantial amount of research assessing the effects of different traffic calming measures, even if there is no unanimous evidence for some of them, such as speed cushions (in particular Berlin speed cushions). Some research on speed cushions has been conducted, even if different results were achieved, also varying with the country and context of installation. Moreover, some of these studies are old and they need to be updated, given the continuous transformation of urban environments. In agreement with the City of Bari, thanks to ASSET-Puglia Region funds, the Italian Ministry of Infrastructures and Transport has granted permission to install speed cushions on three urban streets located in restricted speed zones (≤30 km/h) in the City of Bari, to test their effects on vehicular traffic. In this context, this article is aimed at assessing the preliminary results obtained, considering the effects on vehicular speeds. The study design is a typical before-and-after study, in which speeds are measured using a laser speed gun on the three selected road segments before and after the implementation of speed cushions (for each segment, the cushion has a different width). Visual observations were also useful to detect the effects of speed cushions on trajectories and speeds of two-wheeled vehicles. The preliminary analysis of speed profiles revealed a consistent decrease in speed for all the three test sites (in particular the operating speed V85, which is reduced by up to approximately 30%). Moreover, it seems that the decrease in speed is more evident as the cushion width decreases. © 2022 The Authors. Published by ELSEVIER B.V.

A smart city comprises of smart health care, smart environment, smart home and smart road transportation system. For all these modernizations both artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) take major parts in smart operation. By using hybrid sensors, the traffic light systems can be triggered depending on the measured volume of traffic, including temporary deactivation of the traffic lights when roads are quiet. The traffic data collected with the hybrid technology is then used to analyse and control traffic volumes. The radar technology for traffic monitoring applications include traffic light controls, speed enforcement, traffic monitoring and traffic classification. Therefore, this proposal suggests exploring design and prototype model and utilize the model for appropriate road traffic monitoring and management system. The objectives of the proposed system are to reduce traffic congestion, to count traffic flow, to classify the traffic, to provide green environment by reducing air-pollution generated by vehicles, to provide safety for stakeholders (pedestrians and driver and passengers) and to forecast traffic flow. © 2020 The Institution of Engineering and Technology."

The question is how are speeds developing? The European Transport Safety Council concludes: There is little progress on reducing speeds in Europe. Similar conclusions can be drawn from the US and Australia. Attitude surveys show that people’s answers are not very consistent and represent statements without any strong bearing on norms or behaviour. Many factors are ‘pro-speed’: higher performance vehicles, more comfort, media coverage, etc. Enforcement, particularly with cameras and with section control is efficient, but the scale of adoption is too small. Traffic calming is efficient in cities, but the most obvious measure is one that makes it impossible to drive faster than the speed limit. During the last 30 years, a few trials have taken place which are promising; speeds at or below the speed limit, improved behaviour, and attitudes. The predicted effect is a reduction of up to 50% of fatalities in a regulation-driven scenario and a benefit to cost ratio of 3.5 to 4.8. It is time for authorities to see to it that lower speeds with the help of efficient vehicle-based solutions becomes part of the agenda. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Romania’s road fatality rate per 100,000 population has improved overall from a 2008 high of around 15 to the current 2019 value of 9.6. However, the rate has flat-lined with no real improvement for the last decade, stalling at around 9.7 over the period 2011-2019 and around double the EU rate. Moreover, Romania’s total annual number of road deaths has remained at an average of around 1900 fatalities per annum over this period. Romania has been the worst performing country in the European Union (EU) in recent years, and one of the worst performing countries compared to Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) nations in terms of road safety. The review performed in 2016 found inadequate political leadership and commitment to effective actions to reduce road fatalities, fragmented government road safety activities across a number of regulatory entities, speed limits set at levels that exceed internationally accepted survivable limits, weak traffic law enforcement including a lack of speed enforcement cameras resulting in a failure of drivers to comply with speed limits, and a lack of structured programs to implement human error tolerant road infrastructure constructed according to Safe System principles. A series of recommendations from the capacity review were adopted (as described here) since 2016, although much remains to improve road safety in Romania. © 2020, Australasian College of Road Safety.

This study examines the factors influencing Maximum Abbreviated Injury Scale (MAIS) 2+ injuries to belted car drivers using Indian crash data. Methods: Crash data obtained from Road Accident Sampling System–India (RASSI; 2011 to 2020) were used. Analysis was performed on a sample of 662 belted car drivers, representing 1.7 million drivers nationally. Survey logistic regression was used to identify factors influencing the odds of MAIS 2+ injuries to belted car drivers. Factors including delta-V, mass ratio (striking vehicle/struck vehicle), crash type, and driver age and gender were examined. The model fits and the statistical significance of each factor included in the models were examined. In addition, clinical review of crashes with belted drivers sustaining MAIS 3+ injury is presented. Results: Delta-V was the most significant factor (odds ratio = 12%; 95% confidence interval 6%–19%) influencing belted driver injuries. Older drivers (55+ years) have a higher odds of MAIS 2+ injury. By adding mass ratio to the model, the odds ratio for delta-V increased to 1.16. If the mass ratio is 2.5 (striking vehicle weight = 2.5 times struck vehicle weight), then the odds of MAIS 2+ injury for the struck vehicle driver doubles. The average Delta-V for MAIS 2+ crashes is 34 mph and injury risk increases significantly when delta-V approaches 30 mph. Seventy percent of crashes with injured drivers had a mass ratio >2. For drivers with minor/no injuries, 88% of crashes had a mass ratio <2. Review of MAIS 3+ injury crashes showed that these crashes had a high delta-V (38 mph) and high mass ratio (5). Sixty percent of belted drivers sustained MAIS 3+ head or chest injury resulting from reduction in survival space. About 37% of AIS 3+ head injuries were subdural hemorrhages and 20% were crush injury to head. AIS 3+ chest injuries were rib fractures (40%) and lung lacerations/ruptures (27%). Conclusion: Delta-V and mass ratio are significant factors of belted driver injuries in India. Serious injuries are mainly to the head and chest. Increased rear underrun protection device (RUPD) fitment rate, improved airbag and RUPD design, safe speed enforcement, and improved road infrastructure will reduce injury severity. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

In this work, we demonstrate a novel method to estimate speed of vehicle in the traffic video without using the additional sensor. We implement two speed measurement models which are measuring traveling distance of the vehicle in a given unit of time and measuring traveling time in a given unit of distance. To get parameters of the models, we define four virtual intrusion lines on road in the camera view. Then, YOLOv3, DeepSORT, GoodFeatureToTrack, and Pyramidal Lucas-Kanade optical flow algorithm are implemented together to detect and track the target vehicle while moving in the camera view. From the tracking data, pixel displacement between two consecutive frames (before and after the vehicle crossing the line) is measured as Crossing distance. The number of frames that the vehicle uses while moving from the first line to the other lines is measured as Traveling time. These two parameters at each intrusion line are used as speed measurement metrics. Solution of the metrics are solved by using tracking data of 20 vehicles at 9 different ground truth speeds measured by a laser speed gun. Then, the metrics are used to estimate speed of 813 vehicles. Our best accuracy is with MAE of 3.38 and RMSE of 4.69 km/h when comparing to their ground truth speed. The same dataset are tested on a Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network model. It can reach accuracy with MAE of 3.07 km/h (RMSE 3.98 km/h).  © 2013 IEEE."

To develop a system for vehicle monitoring, vehicle speed measurement is very useful parameter that can be useful to detect over speed in speed limit area or detection of possibly accident due to over speed. To reduce the cost of Speed gun or sensors, computer vision technologies are very useful to develop a system for vehicle speed measurement that takes CCTV footage as input. To calculate a speed efficiently, tracking of vehicle from video is crucial part. The paper proposes a system for tracking a vehicle based on optical flow and Shi-Tomasi corner detection.

This study investigates the levels of acceptance and support for different types of speed enforcement, particularly ASE, and the influence of informative statements or suggested ASE policies on levels of acceptance and support among a representative sample of British Columbians. Methods: The online survey was conducted by Insights West, a public opinion research firm, in March 2018. Survey respondents were 802 British Columbians, stating their approval of 7 types of speed enforcement and 16 pro-ASE and con-ASE statements on a four-point Likert scale. They were also presented with two informative statements and 11 suggested ASE policies as a six-point Likert scale representing likelihood of support of ASE considering various critical elements. Results: The majority of British Columbians polled demonstrated acceptance and support for the use of ASE technologies in B.C., and strategies designed to foster strong public buy-in for implementation and expansion of ASE technologies were delineated. Conclusion: This survey highlighted the areas which need to be strengthened in order to garner and maintain sufficient community acceptance and support for the ASE program. The findings would be instructive for any jurisdiction that aims to deploy ASE technologies to reduce the burden of preventable transport injuries and deaths. © 2022 The Authors"

Using the SUMO software, agent-based models for a 6-km highway without exits or obstacles were created. Telematics data from 93,160 trips were used to determine the desired free-flow speed. A total of 13,860 scenarios were simulated with 30 random seeds. The ratio of unsafe driving (RUD) is the spatial division of the total distance travelled at an unsafe speed by the total travel distance. The study compared different SEC implementations under different road traffic and community behaviours using the Power Model and calculated crash risk changes. Results showed that adding one or two fixed SECs reduced RUD by 0.20% (0.18–0.23) and 0.57% (0.54–0.59), respectively. However, average SECs significantly lowered RUD by 10.97% (10.95–10.99). Furthermore, a 1% increase in telematics enforcement decreased RUD by 0.22% (0.21–0.22). Point-to-point cameras effectively reduced crash risk in all implementation scenarios, with reductions ranging from − 3.44 to − 11.27%, pointing to their superiority as speed enforcement across various scenarios. Our cost-conscious and replicable approach can provide interim assessments of SEC effectiveness, even in low-income countries. © 2024, The Author(s)."

Currently, there are no mechanisms installed at the U.S. passenger terminals that are able to automatically stop a train before reaching the end of the track if an engineer fails to do so. The engineer's actions determine whether the train will safely stop before the end of the terminating track. Thus, incapacitated or inattentive engineer operation would result in end-of-track collisions, such as the New Jersey Transit train accident at Hoboken Terminal in 2016. Currently, PTC enforcement is not required in passenger terminals. In an ongoing project tasked by the Federal Railroad Administration, we study the cost-effectiveness and operational impact of possible PTC enforcement to prevent end-of-track collisions. Specifically, a Concept of Operations (ConOps) was developed to outline the proposed plans to implement two of the most widely used PTC types, namely the Advanced Civil Speed Enforcement System (ACSES) and Interoperable Electronic Train Management System (I-ETMS). This paper describes in-field testing of the ConOps in ACSES-type terminal. In the planned field test, a train equipped with one locomotive and at least one passenger coach would be tested on platform tracks in a selected passenger terminal. These are three major testing components, which are test equipment, test track, and recorded information for each test sequence. Firstly, in terms of equipment, a traffic cone will be placed on the track to simulate a bumping post. In ACSES system, two sets of transponders are programmed to require a positive stop within a specified distance and mounted to the cross ties at specified positions. Secondly, a yard track will be used to test the feasibility of this exercise at the beginning. Upon successfully completing the test multiple times, a series of tests will also be made on the studied platform track. Thirdly, each test run should record the distance from the head end of the test train and the traffic cone for each test run. In addition, ACSES system should also record the information on the ACSES display as it passes the first and second transponder set, respectively. Overall, the field tests presented in this paper, along with previous work in benefit-cost analysis and operational impact assessment, can contribute to an assessment of the proposed PTC implementation at stub-end terminals in the United States in order to effectively and efficiently prevent end-of-track collisions. © 2020 ASME"

DFSs are dynamic speed display signs aimed at providing positive guidance to drivers with the goal of improving compliance to posted speed limits. Given the city’s extensive history with DFS installation, the goal of this study is to evaluate the safety performance of DFSs and to identify factors that can help in determining the future DFS sites selection. A before-and-after evaluation with Empirical Bayes (EB) adjustment was used to account for regression-to-mean bias and other confounding factors. Local safety performance functions and yearly calibration factors were developed using data from a set of reference urban roads. The EB method analysis was utilized to investigate the effect of DFS on different road and intervention types. Results showed significant collision reductions in all scenarios ranging from 31.0% to 41.6%. DFSs were more effective in reducing collisions for arterials compared to collectors. Also, the combined use of DFS and mobile photo enforcement had a slightly higher effect on safety. Initial collision frequencies, traffic volumes, road lengths and the presence of shoulders were found to impact the reduction in collisions for most collision types. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC and The University of Tennessee."

Estimating vehicle information using the speed gun has a high risk of traffic accidents by the operator and the fixed speed camera is not efficient in terms of installation cost and maintenance. The existing driving vehicle information estimation method can only measure each lane’s driving vehicle information, so it is impossible to measure multi-lanes simultaneously with a single measuring device. This study develops a distance measurement module that can acquire driving vehicle information in multi-lanes simultaneously with a single system using a drone. The distance measurement module is composed of two LiDAR sensors to detect the driving vehicle in one lane. The drone is located above the edge of the road and each LiDAR sensor emits the front/rear point of the road measuring point to detect the driving vehicle. The driving vehicle velocity is estimated by detecting the driving vehicle’s detection distance and transit time through radiation, with the drone LiDAR sensor placed at two measurement points on the road. The drone LiDAR sensor radiates two measuring points on the road and estimates the velocity based on driving vehicle’s detection distance and driving time. As an experiment, the velocity accuracy of the drone driving vehicle is compared with the speed gun measurement. The vehicle velocity RMSE for the first and second lanes using drones is 0.75 km/h and 1.3 km/h, respectively. The drone and the speed gun’s average error probabilities are 1.2% and 2.05% in the first and second lanes, respectively. The developed drone is more efficient than existing driving vehicle measurement equipment because it can acquire information on the driving vehicle in a dark environment and a person’s safety. © 2021 by the author.

We use a quasi-experimental research design that compares intervention and control segments before and after installing 90 fixed speed cameras in selected arterial road segments of Bogotá, followed by a confirmatory spatial statistical analysis. Our statistical tests strongly suggest that fixed speed cameras induce compensatory behaviors, noticeably reducing the overall effect of these investments.

The existing systems fail to report most of such violations due to their respective flaws. For instance, speed guns work in isolation and cannot measure speed of all vehicles on roads at all spatial points. They can only detect the speed of the vehicle the line of sight of the camera. A solution is to deploy a huge number of speed guns at different locations on the road to detect and report vehicles that are over speeding. However, this solution is not feasible because it demands a large amount of equipment and computational resources to process such a big amount of data. In this paper, a speed detection framework is developed to detect vehicles’ speeds with only two speed guns, which can report speed even when the vehicle is not within the camera’s line of sight. The system is specifically designed for an irregular traffic scenario such as that of Pakistan, where it is inconvenient to install conventional systems. The idea is to calculate the average speed of vehicles traveling in a specific region, for instance, between two spatial points. A low-cost Raspberry Pi (RPi) module and an ordinary camera are deployed to detect the registration numbers on vehicle license plates. This hardware presents a more stable system since it is powered by a low consumption Raspberry Pi that can operate for hours without crashing or malfunctioning. More specifically, the entrance and exit locations and the time taken to get from one point to another are recorded. An automatic alert to traffic authorities is generated when a driver is over speeding. A detailed explanation of the hardware prototype and the algorithms is given, along with the setup configurations of the hardware prototype, the website, and the mobile device applications. © 2022 by the authors.

It is well known that overarm throwing is one of the most performed activities in the handball. Shoulder and glenohumeral injuries incidence are high in handball because of both pass, and shooting activity was executed repeatedly in high angular speed. Objectives. This study set out to investigate the usefulness of inexpensive commercial inertial movement sensors for prediction of throwing velocity in handball. Methods. After the IMU sensor (500 Hz) placed to the wrist of the dominant arm, players (n=4; 24.4 ±1.4 years, 181.75 ±11 cm height, 84.58 ±16 kg weight) performed 30 standing overarm throwing from a seven-meter distance with 1-minute rest between trials. Throwing velocity compared between radar speed gun and estimations of accelerometer data. Recorded acceleration data filtered (Butterworth 20 Hz 2nd order) than the acceleration vector magnitude calculated. Each throwing data aligned such as 125 data points of before and after the peak acceleration (250ms). Performance metrics of prediction models (Generalized Linear Model, Gradient Boosted Trees, and Support Vector Machine) calculated with root mean square, absolute error, and correlation coefficient parameters. Results. There were reasonably small absolute errors and root mean square values of the machine learning models. Also, there was a very high correlation between measured and predicted velocities with all three models. Conclusion. This is the first study to examined machine learning models to predict handball throwing velocity using a high-frequency triaxial accelerometer. The finding of the present study revealed that the wrist-attached accelerometer precisely estimates the throwing velocity in handball. Further research is required to quantifying the overarm activities in handball, which included block, defensive contact, passing, or shooting. Therefore, the accelerometer-based collected data may provide detection of movement in game-play automatically so that the upper extremity load of players can be monitored and avoid the possible overuse injury risk. © 2020.

For instance, various U.S. states reported an increase in the rate of fatal and severe injury crashes over this duration. In April and May of 2020, comprehensive stay-at-home orders were issued across the country, including in Maine. These orders resulted in drastic reductions in traffic volume. Additionally, there is anecdotal evidence that speed enforcement had been reduced during pandemic. Drivers responded to these changes by increasing their speed. More importantly, data show that speeding continues to occur, even one year after the onset of the pandemic. This study develops statistical models to quantify the impact of the pandemic on speeding in Maine. We developed models for three rural facility types (i.e., major collectors, minor arterials, and principal arterials) using a mixed effect Binomial regression model and short duration speed and traffic count data collected at continuous count stations in Maine. Our results show that the odds of speeding by more than 15 mph increased by 34% for rural major collectors, 32% for rural minor arterials, and 51% for rural principal arterials (non-Interstates) during the stay-at-home order in April and May of 2020 compared to the same months in 2019. In addition, the odds of speeding by more than 15 mph, in April and May of 2021, one year after the order, were still 27% higher on rural major collectors and 17% higher on rural principal arterials compared to the same months in 2019. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"

A pedestrian gap acceptance model indicated that installing the crosswalk did not have any significant effect on the pedestrians’ sensitivity to waiting time, gap size, or the speed of the approaching vehicles. However, it caused reductions in the speed of approaching vehicles which in turn encouraged pedestrians to accept shorter gaps. A micro-simulation model indicated that the crosswalk would reduce the speed on the street slightly, with significant reductions observed if more pedestrians who currently cross at midblock locations shift to use the crosswalk.

The local road safety committee, including public and private interdisciplinary parties, recently implemented the automated speed enforcement camera project along this corridor to achieve safer speeds. The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of the implemented project. The results indicated that this project decreased vehicle speed by 9.6% and increased the efficiency of the speed limit enforcement program six to eight times. Accidents, injuries, and fatalities rates decreased by 5.8%, 7.7%, and 34.3%, respectively. These outcomes prove the efficiency of the first stage of this speed control project in the context of developing cities. Further speed management programs are also discussed. The findings would be beneficial for other developing cities whose urban arterial roads encounter traffic accidents that are primarily caused by speeding. © 2019 The Authors"

The speed of the motorcyclists was measured by using handheld speed guns. Measurements were conducted at over 300 locations scattered all over Belgium. All motorcycles passing these locations were measured, and, as a control group, the speed of one car after each observed motorcycle was measured as well. Seven different road types were distinguished: 30 km/h (zone 30), 30 km/h (school zone), 50 km/h, 70 km/h, 90 km/h (single lane), 90 km/h (double lane) and 120 km/h (highways). Only locations without particular properties or infrastructural measures that could impede the driven speed were chosen. The mean free speed, the 85th percentile of free speed (V85) and the frequency of speed infringements were calculated for the control group (passenger cars) and for two different types of powered two-wheelers: motorbikes and motorscooters. Only the observations where the driver could freely choose its speed were used. On all road types, the V85 values based on free speed measures of all three vehicle types are above the speed limit. Except in zones 30 and on highways, the V85 values for motorbikes are 6 to 8 km/h higher than those for cars. The share of motorcyclists exceeding the 70 km/h speed limit with more than 10 km/h is twice as large the share of car drivers committing the same offence. Only on highways, motorcyclists did not commit more speed infringements than car drivers. The study reveals that excessive speed is a widespread problem among motorcyclists, even more than among car drivers. The average free speed of motorcyclists on 50 to 90 km/h roads was significantly higher than that of car drivers (control group). © 2016 The Authors."

This fact may occur due to the wide prevalence of speed enforcement among the road network. This paper aims to investigate criteria for selecting the best locations of speed cameras on rural highways. Data were collected at 76 sites of existing fixed speed cameras on rural highways of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi during a period of three months. The historical speeding violations, traffic information, aspects of the speed camera, and road characteristics were collected at each site. The statistics show that about 8,110,985 speeding violation tickets were issued between the years from 2008 till 2015 which represents around 80% of total violations. A model to predict the frequency of speeding violations was developed by using negative binomial regression approach. About fifteen independent variables/predictors were examined and are seen to significantly affect the occurrence of speeding violations frequency at a confidence level of 95%. These variables include traffic-related variables (i.e. traffic volume, average speed, and percentage of trucks); site and camera's characteristics related variables (i.e. posted speed limit, speed margin, direction of enforcement camera, straight road segment, existence of speed change zone); and types of day. These findings can be used as selection criteria to find the best locations for installing speed cameras in the future enforcement programs. © Avestia Publishing, 2017."

Vision Zero provides a unique opportunity to bring several 'traditional' safety programs that were previously developed across transportation modes (such as highway, bicycle and pedestrian) and agency responsibilities (such as engineering, education and enforcement). The program uses a collaborative approach involving multiple agencies and the users of the transportation systems and makes more effective use of data, education, enforcement, and engineering to derive cross-cutting solutions.

As with any pulsed laser lidar, its maximum range is limited by available incoming signal to noise ratio. That ratio determines not only maximum range, but also accuracy of measurement. For fast and precise measurements of speed of the vehicles their displacement should be measured with centimeter accuracy. However that demand is hard to reach on long distances and poor quality of the echo signal. Improving accuracy beyond given by a single pulse probing requires emission of several probing pulses. Total displacement error will than fall with the square root of the number of executed measurements. Yet this method will not extend available distance beyond the limit set by threshold detection systems. Acquisition of the full waveform of received signals is a method that allows extension of maximum range through synchronic addition of subsequent waveforms. Doing so improves SNR by a well-known factor of square root of the number of carried additions. Disadvantage of this method is that it requires use of fast analog to digital converters for data acquisition, and simple distance calculation algorithms may not give the adequate accuracy due to relatively long sampling period of reasonable priced ADC's. In this article more advanced algorithms of distance calculations that base on ADC raw data are presented and analyzed.

The use of low-power wide-grip tools, working at a depth of 10…14 cm with high speeds of up to 15…20 km/h, allows you to provide an economic effect, reduce the time for spring work, and reduce the number of service personnel. Sometimes the same effect can be achieved through the use of combined machines that perform several successive operations for tillage, fertilization and sometimes sowing in one pass. In recent years, disc rippers with individual spring-loaded mounting of discs to the frame (diskators) and milling cultivators that fit organically into the combined machines are used for such purposes. However, now long-term observations of the use of these expensive and complex tools, along with high tool traffic, increased working speed and reliability of the process, fuel economy, etc., revealed a number of significant shortcomings in relation to cultivated crops – gradual soil compaction, especially chernozem, decrease in productive moisture, increased contamination of fields, uneven depth of processing, increase in erosion-hazardous particles and, as a result of all this, a tendency to decrease in yield. In addition to high quality crumbling of the soil, drive machines have, especially domestic mills, low productivity, low reliability, high fuel consumption and an increase after passing through erosion-hazardous fractions. This is facilitated by the lack of multi-speed gearboxes on our cutters, which usually make it possible to regulate the quality of crumbling by controlling the kinematic parameter – the ratio of peripheral and translational speeds. The purpose of the study is to identify cases of irrational use of so-called. «Aggressive» tillage tools and identify ways of minimizing possible deficiencies noted. The research methods consist in analyzing the deficiencies arising from the operation of the selected type of tools, identifying the causes of their occurrence and indicating concrete steps to eliminate them. The results of the research are presented on real models currently being produced in Belagromash- Service LLC, for which the load characteristics of the most popular samples are given. In order to avoid the irrational use of the considered modern tools, a number of measures are given to increase the efficiency of their use, the yield of cultivated plants and the efficiency of tools by reducing the negative impact of working bodies on the cultivated soil (for diskators) and the drive for milling machines. © 2019, Eco-Vector LLC.

The non-contact optical speed sensor and the GPS speed sensor are the two most common types of standard speed-measuring instruments. The non-contact optical speed sensor requires extremely high installation accuracy, and its speed-measuring error is nonlinear and uncorrectable. The speed-measuring accuracy of the GPS speed sensor is rapidly reduced if the amount of received satellites is insufficient enough, which often occurs in urban high-rise regions, tunnels, and mountainous regions.

Almost half (47%) of those who began with a neutral or negative opinion of ASE moved toward a more favorable opinion of it. Those who changed their opinion were more engaged (e.g., considered the opposite of their current stance more fully) and were persuaded by evidence of safety benefits that result from effective speed reduction with ASE deployment."

Method: Interrupted time-series analyses were conducted to estimate the effect of the ASEP. Results: Overall, the ASEP was associated with a decrease of 19.7% in traffic fatalities and crashes with injuries. Significant diminutions were observed for passenger vehicles/light SUVs (-25.4%), motorcyclists (-39.0%), and trucks (-15.7%). Adding red light cameras and devices taking pictures of both ends of the vehicle produced, in some cases, additional gains among specific categories of road users. Conclusion: Traffic fatalities, crashes with injuries and the severity of crashes significantly declined following the introduction of the ASEP in November 2003. Practical applications: ASEPs are an effective strategy to prevent traffic casualties.

Given that appropriate deployment decisions are essential to a program's effectiveness, a number of deployment priorities are generally included in most ASE guidelines. However, when implementing the guidelines, most descriptions of deployment goals are so qualitative that they might have multiple quantitative interpretations, and thus affecting the identification of specific deployment considerations. In addition, limited research has been done to improve the process by which guidelines are implemented. Therefore, this paper proposes quantitative measures for an ASE program, in order to facilitate interpretation of the main ASE principles and improve deployment decisions. To illustrate the various types of high-priority deployment considerations, a case study in the city of Edmonton in the province of Alberta, Canada is presented. It explores the deployment outcomes of the mobile photo enforcement (MPE) program in Edmonton, in relation to six priorities identified in the provincial enforcement guidelines. Two performance measures, spatial coverage and enforcement intensity, are assessed for priority sites and non-priority sites. Moreover, the distance halo effects of MPE are considered in the review of spatial coverage. All findings are visualized using Geographic Information Systems, such that high priority sites and coverage of these sites in the historical deployment can be visually assessed. A better understanding of the governing ASE guidelines and how to implement them can help enforcement agencies to improve decision-making and resource allocation, thereby increasing program effectiveness and efficiency. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd."

The vulnerability of this population requires immediate attention from policy makers to implement effective interventions that lessen the burden of injuries in these countries. Our aim was two-fold; first, to review all the evidence on effective interventions for the five main types of unintentional injury; and second, to estimate the potential number of lives saved by effective injury interventions among the poorest billion. Methods: For our systematic review we used references in the Disability Control Priorities third edition, and searched PubMed and the Cochrane database for papers published until Sept 10, 2016, using a comprehensive search strategy to find interventions for the five major causes of unintentional injuries: road traffic crashes, falls, drowning, burns, and poisoning. Studies were included if they presented evidence with significant effects sizes for any outcome; no inclusions or exclusions made on the basis of where the study was carried out (ie, low-income, middle-income, or high-income country). Then we used data from the Global Burden of Disease 2015 study and a Monte Carlo simulation technique to estimate the potential annual attributable number of lives saved among the poorest billion by these evidence-based injury interventions. We estimated results for 84 countries where the poorest billion live. Findings: From the 513 papers identified, 47 were eligible for inclusion. We identified 11 interventions that had an effect on injury mortality. For road traffic deaths, the most successful interventions in preventing deaths are speed enforcement (>80 000 lives saved per year) and drink-driving enforcement (>60 000 lives saved per year). Interventions potentially most effective in preventing deaths from drowning are formal swimming lessons for children younger than 14 years (>25 000 lives saved per year) and the use of crèches to supervise younger children (younger than 5 years; >10 000 lives saved per year). We did not find sufficient evidence on interventions for other causes of unintentional injuries (poisoning, burns, and falls) to run similar simulations. Interpretation: Based on the little available evidence, key interventions have been identified to prevent lives lost from unintentional injuries among the poorest billion. This Article provides guidance to national authorities on evidence-based priority interventions that can reduce the burden of injuries among the most vulnerable members of the population. We also identify an important gap in knowledge on the effectiveness and the mortality impacts of injury interventions.

As a result, highway users have to deal with work zone activities such as lane closures and lane shifts or crossovers, and they must be aware of changes in road conditions to drive safely through work zones. A large-scale statewide crash database from the Virginia Department of Transportation was used in this study to examine correlations between precrash actions and the severity of the injuries of drivers involved in crashes. An innovative aspect of this study is that it accounts for the injury severity of each vehicle driver involved in a crash by estimating hierarchical models. The correlates of the severity of a driver's injury are nested in crashes. Modeling revealed that for work zone crashes the chances of driver injury are 9.9% to 10.3% higher than for the base behavior (i.e., no improper actions by the driver) if the driver intentionally commits an improper action or a violation. For non-work zone crashes, the chances of injury are higher by only 1.7% to 5.7% compared with the base behavior. Such actions and violations are mainly the following: (a) speeding, (b) following too closely, and (c) disregarding officers, faggers, signals, and signs. The correlations between precrash actions and injury severity provide insights into safety improvements (e.g., effective speed enforcement and traffic regulations) that could reduce the risk of injury in work zones. Hierarchies embedded in highway crash data were explored in this study to make methodological and empirical contributions to the understanding of work zone safety and to improve understanding of behaviors that lead to injuries and fatalities in work zone crashes."

It was found that in most corridors the average speeds were lower in the second stage.

Stemming from deterrence theory (Gibbs, 1985; Homel, 1988) the factors of “celerity”, “certainty”, and “severity” of the sanction were explored as a function of type of speed enforcement (automatic radars vs. police officers) and knowledge of enforcement location (known vs. unknown). Coping factors (e.g., self-efficacy, response cost) from protection motivation theory (PMT; Rogers, 1983) were also considered as critical variables of compliance. Participants (245 students, 51% men) had to choose their speed behavior in a mental simulation of a driving episode on a freeway. As expected, the intention to speed was lower when speed-enforcement warning messages were announced than in the control situation. Threat-certainty ratings were higher when automatic radars were announced, but speeding intentions did not vary according to the automatic versus human type of speed enforcement. Furthermore, automatic radars were perceived as easier to cope with in a maladaptive way (i.e., self-efficacy for avoiding a sanction and adapting speed as a function of speed-enforcement location). An unknown speed-enforcement location was one way of decreasing both women's and men's speed. Men calculated a cost-benefit balance to avoid slowing down when they knew the enforcement location. Concerning the predictors of speeding intentions and motivations to reduce speed, self-efficacy ratings for reducing one's speed proved to be the best PMT predictor. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

Aquatic turtles that are heavily dependent on basking in sunlight to maintain an optimal body temperature may abandon basking perches because they perceive humans as potential predators. The impact of boat traffic, the availability of basking structures, and various environmental factors on the basking behaviour of the ringed sawback turtle (Graptemys oculifera) was assessed at two sites on the Pearl River, Mississippi, USA. This information was used to model the likely effects of human disturbance on the body temperature of large female turtles. Both the duration of basking and the percentage of turtles in a basking group that abandoned their basking perch were influenced by the availability of alternative basking sites, frequency of boat traffic, boat speed enforcement zones (‘wake’ or ‘no wake’), boat type, air temperature, weather conditions, and Julian day. A simulation model of anthropogenically disturbed and undisturbed adult female ringed sawbacks showed that disturbance probably decreases the mean daily body temperature, especially at higher disturbance probabilities and in May, when the air temperature is low. Management recommendations are provided that minimize the adverse effects of unintentional human disturbance of the ringed sawback to enable more effective conservation of this endangered, endemic species. Such methods are likely to be useful elsewhere as recreational disturbance becomes a greater conservation issue worldwide. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

The article also proposes measures to improve the actual situation. Most measures implemented in Quebec target the driver (ex., laws, traffic enforcement programs, media campaigns). For instance, selective traffic enforcement programs have been conducted to deter drinking-and-driving and to increase seat-belt use. A graduated driver-licensing program has been developed in order to prevent accidents involving young drivers. An automated speed enforcement program has been gradually introduced as of 2009. At last, the implementation of effective prevention measures was made possible by strong multi-sectorial collaborations. Several laws, activities and forums support collaborations and exchanges between difmainferent actors concerned by traffic safety issues.

They appear to be less interested in or even oblivious to the mechanism and accuracy of the measurement or where in the flight path of the ball the measurement is actually made. Radar speed guns using the Doppler effect are often employed for such speed measurements. It is well known that such guns virtually always measure the line-of-sight or radial velocity of the ball and as such will return a reading less than or equal to the true speed of the ball. In this paper, using only basic physics principles we investigate such measurements, in particular those associated with the service stroke in tennis. For the service trajectories employed here, a single radar gun located in line with the centre-line of the court in fact under-estimates the speed of a wide serve by about 3.4% at the point of delivery, and by about 14.3% on impact with the court. However, we demonstrate that both the magnitude and direction of the true velocity of the ball throughout its entire flight path may be obtained, at least in principle, by the use of four suitably placed radar speed guns. These four guns must be able to measure the 'range' to the ball, enabling its position in flight to be determined, and three of them must be able to measure the radial velocity of the ball. Restrictions on the locations of the speed guns are discussed. Such restrictions are quite liberal, although there are certain configurations of the radar gun positions which cannot be used. Importantly, with the one proviso that no speed gun can be directly in the path of the ball (not only for the obvious reasons), we find that if the speed of the ball can be determined for one point in the trajectory, it can also be determined for all points. The accuracy of the range and radial velocity measurements required to give meaningful results for the true velocity are also briefly discussed. It is found that the accuracy required for these measurements depends on the location of both the radar guns and the ball itself, and must be determined for each particular situation. © 2016 The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences."

Speed cameras have limited coverage and the effect of them on speed behavior is unclear. This may lead to irrational decision making on the investment and configuration of enforcement facilities. In this study, required sample speed data were collected in five cross-sections around a speed camera in G45 (Daguang Freeway) of China. Statistics showed that the distance effect model of the speed camera is a concave parabola function. Speeding drivers begin to slow down to speed limits when they approach advance warning signs and then immediately speed up after passing the enforcement site. The deterrent effect of fixed-site speed enforcement is limited to a 300-m range. It was concluded that there is an obvious distance halo effect of fixed-site speed enforcement by deterrence theory. The findings imply that the deterrent effect of fixed-site speed enforcement is weak due to its short effective distance and overt form of control. Reasonable configuration of enforcement facilities and combination with mobile speed enforcement will be appropriate to reduce speeding. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2017."

The achieved reduction in collision risks and injury severity were evaluated using real-time crash risk and severity prediction models. A modified cell transmission model (CTM) that took into consideration the capacity drop and the stop-and-go traffic was used to simulate the traffic operations with the VSL control. A computational procedure that incorporated the genetic algorithm and the CTM was proposed for the optimization of critical VSL control factors. Three scenarios with various placements of VSL signs on freeway mainlines were evaluated. The results showed that the optimal VSL control successfully decreased the collision risks by 22.62% and reduced the injury severity of crashes by 14.67%. We also evaluated how drivers' compliance to speed limits affected the effectiveness of VSL control. The safety effects decreased as drivers' compliance rate to the VSL control decreased. The finding suggests the use of speed enforcement techniques together with the VSL control to achieve the optimum control effects. © 2016 Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering."

Design: Exploratory Study. Setting: Laboratory. Participants: Nineteen male collegiate participants (22.5 ± 3.2 years, 181.1 ± 6.7 cm, 80.3 ± 9.6 kg). Main outcome measures: All participants performed VDJ and HDJ from a 20 cm height onto an AMTI force platform sampling at 1200 Hz before performing three 20 m sprints. Sprint times (5, 10, 15, 20, 5-10, 10-15, 15-20 m) were measured using a LAVEG speed gun. Results: All jump and sprint measures showed excellent within session reliability (ICC: 0.954 to 0.99). Pearson's and Spearman's correlations revealed significant (p < 0.01) moderate to high correlations between jump measures and sprint times (R: -0.665 to -0.769). Stepwise multiple regression revealed jump distance normalised by body height (HDJ) was the best predictor for 10, 20, 5-10, 10-15 and 15-20 m sprint times (R2 = 41%-48%).

Recent technological developments enable a wide range of alternative traffic monitoring possibilities. In particular, the availability of cellular and GPS devices creates the opportunity to utilize probe vehicle data. To date, most studies using probe vehicle data focused on operational purposes such as congestion identification, relying primarily on average speeds. Probe vehicle data can also be useful for safety studies. The data is often collected continuously (24/7, 365 days a year). It can therefore enable detailed analyses of the continuous changes in speed over time. In addition, the spatial coverage of the data enables continuous evaluation of the halo effect of speed enforcement installation, compared with a relatively small number of measurement sites (e.g. 3–5) in traditional methods. Probe vehicle data offer one more advantage: When performing a before-after study, the before measurements have to be performed before camera installation. However, installation plans may change, and therefore conducting the before measurements may be administratively challenging. Probe vehicle data, especially if collected continuously, regardless of research needs, enable researchers to choose the desired sites and times for analysis in retrospect, after the cameras have been installed. The purpose of this paper is to describe the results obtained from analysis of probe vehicle data on the effect of speed enforcement cameras that were installed at non-urban roads in Israel during 2011–2013. In addition to the contribution regarding the impact of enforcement cameras, the paper demonstrates the potential (as well as the challenges) of using probe vehicle data for safety studies. The analyses in this paper consider 22 installation sites and 12 comparison sites. The results show that at the installation sites (within 100 m), the 85th percentile speeds exhibited a short-term (two months) reduction of 2.92 km/h (SD = 2.37) and a long-term (one year) reduction of 6.48 km/h (SD = 3.5). An a-symmetric double exponential model is presented to depict the halo effect up to 1.5 km from the installation location. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd"

To address this issue, this study proposes a novel before–after safety evaluation methodology based on survival analysis and longitudinal data as an alternative to the EB/FB method. A Bayesian survival analysis (SARE) model with a random effect term to address the unobserved heterogeneity across sites is developed. The proposed survival analysis method is validated through a simulation study before its application. Subsequently, the SARE model is developed in a case study to evaluate the safety effectiveness of a recent red-light-running photo enforcement program in New Jersey. As demonstrated in the simulation and the case study, the survival analysis can provide valid estimates using only data from treated sites, and thus its results will not be affected by the selection of defective or insufficient reference sites. In addition, the proposed approach can take into account the censored data generated due to the transition from the before period to the after period, which has not been previously explored in the literature. Using individual crashes as units of analysis, survival analysis can incorporate longitudinal covariates such as the traffic volume and weather variation, and thus can explicitly account for the potential temporal heterogeneity. © 2018 Society for Risk Analysis"

In 2009, the state speed camera law increased the enforcement threshold from 11 to 12 mph over the speed limit and restricted school zone enforcement hours. In 2012, the county began using a corridor approach, in which cameras were periodically moved along the length of a roadway segment. The long-term effects of the speed camera program on travel speeds, public attitudes, and crashes were evaluated. Methods: Changes in travel speeds at camera sites from 6 months before the program began to 7½ years after were compared with changes in speeds at control sites in the nearby Virginia counties of Fairfax and Arlington. A telephone survey of Montgomery County drivers was conducted in Fall 2014 to examine attitudes and experiences related to automated speed enforcement. Using data on crashes during 2004–2013, logistic regression models examined the program's effects on the likelihood that a crash involved an incapacitating or fatal injury on camera-eligible roads and on potential spillover roads in Montgomery County, using crashes in Fairfax County on similar roads as controls. Results: About 7½ years after the program began, speed cameras were associated with a 10% reduction in mean speeds and a 62% reduction in the likelihood that a vehicle was traveling more than 10 mph above the speed limit at camera sites. When interviewed in Fall 2014, 95% of drivers were aware of the camera program, 62% favored it, and most had received a camera ticket or knew someone else who had. The overall effect of the camera program in its modified form, including both the law change and the corridor approach, was a 39% reduction in the likelihood that a crash resulted in an incapacitating or fatal injury. Speed cameras alone were associated with a 19% reduction in the likelihood that a crash resulted in an incapacitating or fatal injury, the law change was associated with a nonsignificant 8% increase, and the corridor approach provided an additional 30% reduction over and above the cameras. Conclusions: This study adds to the evidence that speed cameras can reduce speeding, which can lead to reductions in speeding-related crashes and crashes involving serious injuries or fatalities. © 2016 Insurance Institute for Highway Safety."

This paper explores the influence of environmental and road characteristics, situational factors, and individual characteristics on drivers’ observed speed selection in a simulator experiment. The paper presents a theoretical framework for drivers’ speed selection, and applies structural equation modeling for the various factors examined. The simulator experiments collected data of 111 drivers driving in 4 different scenarios composed of 22 segments for each scenario. The dataset was analyzed in several resolutions: Driver level, Trip level, and Segment level. The three models revealed that gender, age, and driving frequency are all significant in determining drivers’ perceptions and attitudes, which in turn influence speed selection. Situational factors such as traffic speed, enforcement, and time-saving-benefits are also related to speed selection, as well as infrastructure characteristics. These findings demonstrate that structural equations provide a flexible modeling tool able to concurrently analyze the variety of factors that relate to speed selection. As a result, Structural Equations Modeling provides more accurate and refined explanations for the combined effects of various factors on drivers’ speed selection than previous research so far. These tools can be useful in developing speed management strategies to improve road safety. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

Modeling these types of traffic streams, in which traffic rules (speed limit, lane discipline, etc.) are not strictly followed, is a complex task. A review of the existing literature shows that there is a lack of traffic flow models that model the behavior of heterogeneous and undisciplined traffic streams. Like other undisciplined traffic streams, there are no speed limits (hence no speed enforcement) on most of the roads in Karachi, Pakistan. Lane discipline is also not observed by drivers, which results in a varying number of traffic lanes on a road. Therefore, most of the existing traffic flow models/simulation packages developed for disciplined traffic streams cannot appropriately model traffic streams without lane discipline. This research proposes a width-based cell transmission model (WCTM) by developing a fundamental flow-density diagram whose parameters are a function of the road width. Extensive field data have been collected from a selected arterial in Karachi for development of the fundamental traffic flow diagram. The values of the computed parameters are significantly different than the values reported in the literature. The piecewise-linear flow-density relation is developed by optimally estimating the breakpoints. Results show that the quadrilateral and pentagonal-shaped fundamental diagrams fit better with the collected data in comparison with the triangular-shaped fundamental diagram. The proposed WCTM is applied to selected segments of an arterial and results show that the WCTM was able to accurately model different traffic conditions. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2019."

Usually, the goal is to select locations based on a number of concerns (i.e., high collision sites, high speed violation sites, school zones, etc.), which, in most cases, is conflicting. If certain locations are given more MPE resources, then by definition, other locations will receive less attention, and vice versa. This paper aims to provide insights about such MPE programme trade-offs. We present a systematic procedure for interpreting the results of a multiobjective MPE resource allocation problem. The procedure consists of three steps: (a) Pareto front (PF) generation, (b) front representation, and (c) trade-off analysis. First, in generating a PF, we sequentially apply two well-known scalar optimization methods to obtain a comprehensive set of Pareto-optimal solutions. Second, the K-medoids clustering algorithm and the silhouette index are adopted to partition the generated PF into similar-sized clusters, in order to help MPE programme agencies choose from a reduced set of solutions on the PF. Third, we use the response surface method to determine trade-off patterns on the PF. The results of the front generation analysis showed that applying two optimization methods together resulted in a nearly complete PF with a relatively uniform and dense spread of solutions. Consequently, the identified set of solutions (i.e., 13,210 cases) was further partitioned into 12 clusters by silhouette index and K-medoids. With the aim of reducing decision fatigue for agencies, each cluster's representative solution is considered a possible MPE resource allocation candidate. The trade-off analysis indicated how much one must sacrifice in the other objectives in order to increase attainment of one particular objective. Finally, the trade-off rate and elasticity were used to explore the quantitative relationship between the considered objectives. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

Three types of volleyballs were used in this study: MVA200, weighing 270 ± 10 g; Prototype Ball A (Type A), weighing 270 ± 10 g; and Prototype Ball B (Type B), weighing 340 ± 10 g. Vertically downward 3-m impact tests were conducted using a serving machine, force plate, and radar speed gun. Contact time, ball speed, mean force, peak force, total impulse, initial momentum, incident impulse, and lost momentum were calculated. Intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated to evaluate the reliability of the data, and one-way analysis of covariance and Scheffe's post hoc analysis were used to analyse the variables of the three ball types. The paired samples t-test was used to compare the difference between initial momentum and incident impulse. The results indicated that the intraclass correlation coefficients of the three ball types were 0.998 (MVA200), 0.997 (Type A), and 0.999 (Type B). Type B considerably surpassed Type A and MVA200 in mechanical factors, and Type A was significantly superior to MVA200 in incident impulse and lost momentum. The results indicated that different volleyballs of the same size, weight, and internal air pressure have dissimilar mechanical features and implied that slight adjustment to ball structure can cause substantial changes in the specific characteristics. In addition, the mass increased the lost momentum, which might cause the ball to bounce unpredictably. © IMechE 2015."

Vehicle operating speeds and historical crash data were collected at multiple sites with posted speed limits set equal to engineering recommendations and sites with posted speed limits set lower than engineering recommendations. Linear, quantile and logistic regression models were estimated to predict mean operating speed, 85th percentile operating speed and speed limit compliance, respectively, as a function of various roadway characteristics and level of speed enforcement. The Empirical-Bayes before-after approach was also used to develop crash modification factors (CMFs) that describe the expected change in total and fatal + injury crash frequency when setting posted speed limits lower than engineering recommendations. Because safety data were collected over a long time period, temporal adjustments were incorporated to account for yearly changes in crash reporting, traffic characteristics and other variables. The results revealed that speed limit compliance worsened as the difference between the engineering recommended and posted speed limits increased. The presence of verified heavy police enforcement reduced both mean and 85th-percentile operating speeds by approximately 4 mph and increased speed limit compliance. The safety analysis found a statistically significant reduction in total, fatal + injury, and property damage only (PDO) crash frequency at locations with posted speed limits set 5 mph lower than engineering recommendations. Locations with posted speed limits set 10 mph lower than engineering recommendations experienced a decrease in total and PDO crash frequency, but an increase in fatal + injury crash frequency. The safety effects of setting speed limits 15 to 25 mph lower than engineering recommendations were less clear, as the results were not statistically significant, likely due to the small sample of sites included in the evaluation. Overall, the results suggest that setting posted speed limits 5 mph lower than the engineering recommended practice may result in operating speeds that are more consistent with the posted speed limits and overall safety benefits. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd"

The goal of this paper was to scientifically evaluate frequently used field set-ups. The following set-ups were tested in one week: (1) police unit 1: speed control with and without a static feedback sign placed after the control; (2) police unit 2: speed control with and without a digital feedback sign placed after the control; (3) police unit 3: speed display followed by a second speed display further along the road section. During certain time frames, speed control took place in between both signs. All tested field set-ups generated significant reductions in the speed level. Studying the effect of the different variations for each set-up reveals that the effect of the speed control is generally larger in combination with the signage alongside the road. After the period during which the police activities took place, speed levels again reached their initial level.

However, there is no MPE design structure to systematically connect deployment decisions back to preset goals. We propose a method to aid MPE managers in using goals directly in the efficient allocation of limited program resources. A neighborhood-level resource allocation model is developed, which uses multi-objective optimization to determine how enforcement is allocated to city neighborhoods. The model is applied to an MPE program in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, and delivered 200 optimal solutions for one month. One illustrative solution is plotted in GIS and assessed alongside the actual program deployment results for the same month. This solution efficiently allocates one month of operator shifts to sites in 44 neighborhoods, based on the specific needs of each neighborhood. The actual MPE deployment was such that 60% of visits occurred in neighborhoods beyond the 44 identified in the illustrative optimal solution. The major contribution of our model is that it allows for MPE managers to quantitatively map performance outcomes to multiple program goals. This can lead to more transparent and efficient MPE programs, which in turn can improve urban road safety and ultimately, urban sustainability. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd"

From the analysis results, two risk factors for the operation of the ETC systems were identified: speed differences between ETC-tagged vehicles and other vehicles with respect to locations, and lane changes as a result of entering the wrong lane. The guidelines suggest a method to calculate the safe distance necessary for lane changing and a lane configuration method to reduce accident risks resulting from speed variance.

Moreover, unlike unidirectional arterials, bidirectional arterials with short intersection spacing are not amenable to green waves that can remove the incentive to speed. This research explores the ways that traffic signal coordination creates - or limits - speeding opportunities on bidirectional arterials. Two measures of speeding opportunity are proposed: number of unconstrained vehicles, meaning vehicles arriving at a stopline on green and with no vehicle less than 5 s ahead of them, and number of speeders in a traffic microsimulation in which 20% of the vehicles have been assigned a desired speed in the '‘speeding’' range. Theoretical analysis, confirmed by two case studies, show how speeding opportunities are related to degree of saturation, cycle length, specified progression speed (as in input to signal timing software), intersection spacing, and recall settings. The important role of clusters of intersections with near-simultaneous greens, a byproduct of bidirectional coordination with short intersection spacing, is examined. Clusters with many intersections are shown to create a strong speeding incentive, and cluster size can be reduced by lowering the cycle length and the progression speed. Case studies show it is sometimes possible to substantially reduce speeding opportunities with little or no increase in vehicular delay by lowering cycle length, lowering progression speed, dividing an arterial into smaller '‘coordination zones’' with each zone having its own cycle length, and by abandoning coordination altogether. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2018."

The method takes advantage of the relation between vibration levels and the cyclic repetition of the excitation forces created by the wheels. A train mask, expressed in the wavelength domain, is derived from a simple rail deflection model induced by the train wheels. The vibration spectrum at very low frequency and the train mask are qualitatively compared to match the various peaks.

Higher safety can lead to more walking and thereby a more sustainable society. Methodology – The chapter is based on a review of literature, including a review of published papers and field studies by the author himself. Findings – To reach ‘acceptable’ safety levels, all arterials and collector roads – at least segments with more than 50 pedestrians a day – should have sidewalks. The sidewalks should be separated from the roadway by a curb if speeds are low and by a barrier or wide separation strip in high-speed areas; that is, where speeds are higher than 50 km/h. Local roads also need sidewalks unless traffic volumes and speeds are very low. The major safety issue for pedestrians is, however, where they cross streets. Elderly pedestrians and pedestrians in a great hurry or under the influence of intoxicants in particular need streets to be narrow and have low speeds for them to be able to cross safely. Marking crosswalks or even signalising them will have only marginal safety effects at best. Posting them for low speed is also not enough unless we have photo speed-enforcement ensuring that everyone drives slowly. Rather, using narrow cross-sections or speed cushions at the approaches ensuring that 90-percentile speeds are no more than 30 km/h at crossing points is key to safety. In between crossing points a speed of 50 km/h is acceptable with pedestrians on adjacent sidewalks. Social implications – We as a society need to encourage walking as a mode of transportation since walking promotes better health and a cleaner environment; that is, a more sustainable society. However, it has to be safe to walk or people will prefer to drive to their destinations. Also, distances between destination points have to be kept reasonably short and the environment, where people walk needs to be interesting and aesthetically somewhat pleasing to encourage walking. © 2018 by Emerald Publishing Limited All rights of reproduction in any form reserved."

These models help stakeholders make informed decisions about any new change in the transport network. Calibration and validation of micro-simulation models are essential steps to ensure the reliability of the models. Most of the existing calibration efforts focus on experimental designs of driver behavior and lane changing parameters that have no physical meaning, or at least, cannot be easily measured. This paper suggests an approach for calibrating micro-simulation models using measurable variables. We advocate using an easy-to-understand, yet appropriate measures of the traffic stream such as spot speed as a calibration parameter. The approach was applied to a suburban corridor of about 12 km located in Greater Cairo Region. Video data were collected for about 9 hours on the corridor for both directions and were used to obtain traffic volumes and composition. Spot speeds were collected using a speed gun for a sample that comprised more than 2,000 vehicles belonging to different vehicle classes. VISSIM was used to model the corridor for only one direction that encompassed uninterrupted flow conditions. Spot speeds distributions were edited extensively in VISSIM to replicate the empirical distributions of the collected data. Furthermore, the distributions were developed for each vehicle type to achieve a higher level of accuracy. Statistical tests were carried out to ensure that the modeled speed distributions match the observed distributions. Corridor travel time was used as a validation parameter. Error measurements were computed for different analysis intervals (e.g., average travel time during a particular range), and it was shown that the validation errors decrease as the analysis period increases. © 12th International Transportation Specialty Conference 2018, Held as Part of the Canadian Society for Civil Engineering Annual Conference 2018.

Objective The aim of this study is to determine the spatiotemporal characteristics of long jumps performed by blind athletes and compare findings with those reported for sighted athletes. Methods We analysed a sample of 12 male athletes competing in the F11 Long Jump Finals at the Paralympic Games in London 2012. Performances were recorded using four high-speed cameras, and speeds were measured using a radar speed gun. The images were processed using validated image analysis software. Results The long jump run-up is shorter in blind athletes than in sighted athletes. We observed statistically significant differences for body centre of mass velocity and an increase in speed over the last three strides prior to take-off, contrasting with reports for sighted athletes and athletes with less severe visual impairment, who maintain or reduce their speed during the last stride. Stride length for the last three strides was the only spatial characteristic that was not significantly associated with effective jump distance. Blind long jumpers extend rather than shorten their last stride. Contact time with the take-off board is longer than that reported for sighted athletes. Conclusion The actions of blind long jumpers, unlike those without disabilities, do not vary their leg actions during the final runway approach for optimal placement on the take-off board. © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2017.

Speed data were collected in six different work zone locations in northern and southern California and used to determine the magnitude and nature of speeding problem in highway work zones. In addition data were collected over 11 test-days in four work zones with four levels of police presence: radar speed display with police decal and lighting, passive use of a police vehicle with radar speed display, passive use of a police vehicle without radar speed display, and active police speed enforcement near work zones. This paper analyzes this data using statistical methods to evaluate the effectiveness of these different methods of speed control on the safety of the work zone. Four Measures of Effectiveness (MOE) were used in this evaluation consisting of average speed reduction, speed variance, 85th percentile speed, and proportion of high speed vehicles.

Whereas, limited research provides convincing solutions for representing speed limit effect and estimating real-time driver compliance at speed transition zones. To fill this research gap, this paper analyses field data from two speed transition zones along southbound of 97th Street, Edmonton, Canada. Temporal and spatial variations of speed and driver compliance are investigated in detail using statistical tests. A linear regression is then established to rank the contributions of the selected factors. Finally, some suggestions and guidelines for VSL algorithm design and implementation are proposed. © 2017, Canadian Science Publishing. All rights reserved."

Inappropriate speed is responsible for more than a third of all fatal accidents occurring on roads. In Poland the problem of speeding drivers is widely present. Hence, effective speed management and enforcement of speed limits on existing roads plays an important role. Possible solutions for rural roads are very limited and are focused mainly on administrative speed limitations and speed cameras enforcement. However, due to their limited effectiveness new solutions are still being sought. High expectations are associated with the automatic section speed control system that has recently been introduced in Poland. The aim of this paper is to examine the efficiency of the automatic section speed control system on the basis of speed surveys collected on chosen national roads where the system for sectional speed control was first implemented. Conducted comparisons and statistical analyses included driver’s average speed, speed percentiles, the number of speeding drivers as well as speed heterogeneity. To evaluate the efficacy of the sectional speed system, speed measurements were also conducted on fourteen, similar in geometry and functional characteristics, reference national roads located in Podlaskie voivodship in Poland without any specific speed enforcement. © 2019, Faculty of Transport and Traffic Engineering.

This paper presents a study on the response of passenger vehicles and minibus taxis to ASE on the R61 in South Africa. A spatio-temporal quantitative study of speed compliance was conducted, where metrics such as speed variability, average speed and 85th percentile speed measured prior to, and during enforcement, were analysed for two prominent modes of transport - passenger vehicles and minibus taxis. These measurements were taken on the enforcement route and on control routes adjacent to and further away from the enforcement route. A qualitative study was also conducted to evaluate the relationship between speed compliance and driver understanding of the system. The impact of the system on crash risk and injury severity was also examined before and during enforcement. For passenger vehicles, results showed that the introduction of ASE was followed by a reduction in mean speed on the enforcement route and adjacent control route. For minibus taxis, it was found that ASE appears to have little influence on improving speed compliance, which is likely associated with a lack of driver understanding of how the system operates."

This study identified circumstances under which the largest increases in deaths occurred during this period. Method: Annual counts of U.S. pedestrian fatalities and crash involvements were extracted from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System and General Estimates System. Poisson regression examined if pedestrian fatalities by various roadway, environmental, personal, and vehicle factors changed significantly during 2009–2016. Linear regression examined changes over the study period in pedestrian deaths per 100 crash involvements and in horsepower per 1000 pounds of weight among passenger vehicles involved in fatal single-vehicle pedestrian crashes Results: Pedestrian deaths per 100 crash involvements increased 29% from 2010, when they reached their lowest point, to 2015, the most recent year for which crash involvement data were available. The largest increases in pedestrian deaths during 2009–2016 occurred in urban areas (54% increase from 2009 to 2016), on arterials (67% increase), at nonintersections (50% increase), and in dark conditions (56% increase). The rise in the number of SUVs involved in fatal single-vehicle pedestrian crashes (82% increase) was larger than the increases in the number of cars, vans, pickups, or medium/heavy trucks involved in these crashes. The power of passenger vehicles involved in fatal single-vehicle pedestrian crashes increased over the study period, with larger increases in vehicle power among more powerful vehicles. Conclusions: Efforts to turn back the recent increase in pedestrian fatalities should focus on the conditions where the rise has been the greatest. Practical applications: Transportation agencies can improve urban arterials by investing in proven countermeasures, such as road diets, median crossing islands, pedestrian hybrid beacons, and automated speed enforcement. Better road lighting and vehicle headlights could improve pedestrian visibility at night. © 2018 National Safety Council and Elsevier Ltd"

In this study, a driving simulator (STISIM) was used to explore drivers' speed choices, and how they are influenced by infrastructure, traffic, risk/benefit, and driver characteristics. Drivers also filled out a stated-preference survey, which included speed selection items and demographic characteristics. The experimental design included four scenarios of a specific risk or benefit to the driver: A daily trip, a higher speed enforcement scenario, a higher crash-risk scenario, and a scenario with high time pressure. The driver sample included 111 drivers from different ages between 20 and 65, with 44% women. The database included 9,768 observations. The largest effect on drivers' speed was under time-saving benefits with an average increase of 10 km/hr. Infrastructure effects included horizontal curves, longitudinal slope changes, and design speed. Age and gender also influenced speed selection. Thus, the most effective measures for speed reduction may be (1) enforcement, (2) design speed, and (3) horizontal curves, in contrast to (1) time-saving benefits and (2) a high average speed of close-by vehicles, which motivated drivers to increase their speed but may be reduced by counteracting policies. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC and The University of Tennessee."

The goal of this study is to evaluate the safety performance of ISDs within the city of Edmonton, Canada and to identify factors that can lead to successful selection of future ISD sites. A before-and-after Empirical Bayes (EB) method is used to account for regression-to-the-mean and other confounding factors.

An MPE program deploys operators driving vehicles equipped with radar and photo equipment to roadway locations where speeding and collision problems are significant. We developed a binary integer linear programming model to allocate MPE shifts over the course of a month to selected enforcement locations. These locations are pre-determined from a set of city neighborhoods chosen for enforcement through a prior multi-objective programming step. A major feature of the scheduling model is to observe the time halo effects of enforcement; our optimization model minimizes visits to an enforcement location over consecutive shifts. The model was applied to data obtained from the currently operating MPE program in Edmonton, Canada. Based on the resource allocation in neighborhoods determined in the previous stage, this scheduling model produces a scheduling plan that allocates resources to individual enforcement sites within each city neighborhood during a month. The purpose of this scheduling model, in combination with the first stage neighborhood allocation model, is to provide enforcement agencies with a tool to systematically and transparently assign limited resources in an efficient manner, providing greater efficacy in achieving program-level objectives such as reducing speeding, reducing collisions, and providing enforcement presence in areas with many vulnerable pedestrians (i.e. school zones). © 2017 IEEE."

In Cali, Colombia, fixed cameras were installed in March 2012 on a number of roads and intersections. All camera devices are capable of detecting simultaneously the following traffic violations: driving over the speed limit, running a red light or stop sign, violation of the traffic ban schedule, and blocking the pedestrian crosswalk. Objective: To evaluate the impact of camera enforcement of traffic violations in Cali, Colombia. Methods: A quasi-experimental difference-in-differences study with before and after measurements and a comparison group was conducted. We observed 38 intervention areas and 50 comparison areas (250 m radius), during 42 months before and 34 months after the installation of cameras. Effects were estimated with mixed negative binomial regression models. Results: In intervention areas, after 12 months, there was a reduction of 19.2% of all crashes and a 24.7% reduction of injury and fatal crashes. In comparison areas, this reduction was 15.0% for all crashes and 20.1% for injury and fatal crashes. After adjusted comparisons, intervention sites outperformed comparison sites with an additional yearly reduction of 5.3% (p = 0.045) for all crashes. Conclusions: The use of cameras for detecting traffic violations seems to have a positive effect on the reduction of crashes in intervention areas. A beneficial spillover effect was found as well in comparison areas; but more evaluations are needed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd"

Understanding how drivers behave towards speed management devices (i.e., speed cameras, radars, speed limits and speed warning signs) as well as factors affecting drivers’ involvement in speed-related crashes might help in improving traffic safety. This study aims to identify and quantify the factors that affect drivers’ compliance with speed enforcement and management devices as well as drivers’ involvement in at-fault speed-related crashes in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi (AD), UAE. Two different datasets were collected from the same drivers’ population in AD to provide different valuable information regarding the speeding problem. The first dataset was obtained from crashes’ reports while, the second dataset was obtained from a self-reported questionnaire survey that was carried out among a total of 442 drivers in AD. Three logistic regression models were developed to identify the significant variables that affect (1) the occurrence of speed related crash (using crashes reports data), (2) drivers’ compliance with speed limits (using questionnaire data), and (3) involvement in at-fault speed related crashes (using questionnaire data). The findings revealed that drivers’ factors (gender, age, and nationality), vehicle factor (vehicle type), roads and environment factors (weather, road type and speed limit) were the significant factors that affect the occurrence of speed-related crashes in AD. The questionnaire findings revealed that running late, low values of posted speed limits and no sufficient police enforcement were the three main reasons that make motorists drive over the speed limits. In addition, the results indicated that drivers’ characteristics (i.e., gender, education and income), drivers’ responses to speed enforcement and management devices, and drivers’ awareness about the importance of such devices in improving traffic safety were the main factors that affecting both drivers’ compliance with speed enforcement devices and drivers’ involvement in at-fault speed-related crashes.

Thus, the effect of them on speeding behavior is unclear. This lack of knowledge on the effect of the cameras may lead to irrational decision making in terms of investment in and configuration of enforcement facilities. In this study, sample speed data were collected at five locations near a speed camera on the G45 Freeway (i.e., the Daguang Freeway) in China. Statistics showed that the distance effect model of the speed camera can be represented by a concave parabolic function. Speeding drivers begin to slow down to speed limits when they approach advance warning signs, and then they immediately speed up after passing the enforcement site. The deterrent effect of fixed-site speed enforcement is limited to a 300-meter range. Deterrence theory was used to conclude that there is an obvious distance halo effect for fixed-site speed enforcement locations. The findings of this study imply that the deterrent effect of fixed-site speed enforcement is weak due to its short effective distance and overt form of control. Ultimately, reasonable configuration of enforcement facilities and use of fixed-site facilities in combination with mobile speed enforcement are appropriate methods that can be used to reduce speeding. © 2016 ASCE."

The speed photo enforced and reduced speed limit signs were placed at intervals before the start of the work zone and in the work zone. A virtual work zone network was built to replicate the Baltimore–Washington Parkway (MD-295). A total of 66 participants from different socioeconomic backgrounds participated in 264 driving simulation sessions. The speeds were measured over four phases: initial speed area, sign visible area, sign readable area and post sign area. An analysis of variance and post hoc analysis showed that the speed photo enforced sign was the most effective of the three signs. The second speed photo enforced sign within the work zone was more effective at reducing speed than the sign before the start of the work zone, especially in the post sign area.

Within this study, researchers from Hasselt University worked together with 3 regional police units to test the effect of two frequently used speed interventions namely a speed control (i.e. stationary police control in an unmarked police car equipped with a mobile radar) with and without an advanced (digital) warning sign alongside the road. The effect of these 2 types of interventions is tested on two road segments of regional roads (with a maximum speed of 70 and 90 km/h), whereby interventions were switched between both roads during the second field experiment. To measure the effect of both methods, the average speed, 85th percentile of speed and odds of drivers exceeding the speed limit were analyzed, mainly by using general linear regression models. Results show for each tested intervention, significant speed reductions during the time that enforcement was in place. Generalizing these results, allows us to conclude that the effect during the speed control with advanced warning sign is larger compared to the speed control only (respectively -4.5 km/h and -2.5 km/h in the V85 speed) and also the continuing effect until one week after the intervention is higher. In the future, we recommend repeating the experiment on more locations, to enhance the reliability and generalizability of the results.

ATM systems apply proactive strategies to improve safety and mobility, as well as to reduce emissions, noise, and fuel consumption. As one of the key elements in the ATM toolbox, variable speed limit (VSL) systems are being increasingly deployed around the United States. In the past, most VSL systems in Europe have included automated enforcement as part of the system, while systems in the United States have relied on traditional speed enforcement strategies. In the Portland, Oregon, metropolitan area, a new traffic-and weather-responsive VSL system has been deployed. It uses variable advisory speeds (VAS), allowing law enforcement to rely on the basic rule for enforcement. Thanks to the availability of high-resolution intelligent transportation systems data, it is possible to conduct post hoc analysis after VSL deployments. This paper focuses on driver compliance with displayed VAS messages. ""Compliance"" is defined as the difference between the displayed speed and the measured speed of traffic. In addition to analyzing more than 35 days at the Portland site, for comparison purposes, some additional analysis of a VSL site in Munich, Germany, is also included. The analysis of compliance for VSL-VAS deployments is useful for understanding the benefits of these important ATM strategies, assisting with targeting enforcement actions, and better understanding where and when to employ VSL-VAS systems. © 2016, National Research Council.

However, no significant correlations were observed in trunk rotation angle (anterior and posterior), foot direction (p>0.05).Greater shoulder horizontal abduction during pitching motion has effective pre-stretch, stored elastic energy and tendons may be utilized during arm cocking and arm acceleration phase of pitch. As increased trunk rotation angular velocity, levels of trunks action develop more advanced and led to increases in energy transfer to the pitching arm. For stride length, it is regarded a not only critical kinematic factor for determine the timing of kinetic chain events but also transitioning energy to the pitching arm from lower extremity. In this study, we can compare with previous studies on pitching motion kinematics. Also previous studies on pitching motion analysis were mainly 3D camera based techniques. In this study, it is meaningful to analyze the pitching motion by using Gyro sensor which complements the limitation that 3D camera technique can have. Improvements/Applications: Horizontal abduction and abduction of shoulder, trunk rotation angular velocity and stride length should be considered to increase the ball velocity, which is an important ability of the pitcher. © 2018, World Informations Syndicate.

Speed has been identified as a factor in road accidents, influencing both the risk of accidents and the severity of the accidents. However, speeding is one of :he most frequent violations of traffic rules by the road users. Many results of studies showed that the implementation of speed cameras significantly reduced the vehicle speed and the number of accidents near camera sites. One issue regarding speed enforcement by a speed camera is that a reduction in speed is obtained only on a short section of a road. The results of scientific research analysis suggest that this issue can be overcome by the employment of average speed enforcement system (hereafter system), which is a relatively new approach to traffic law enforcement. Until now, Lithuania had no methodology for selecting road sections to be installed with the system. The purpose of this paper is to develop a model for the assessment of safety impact of the system and to perform economic estimation of a system of Lithuanian main road sections selected under this model. The analysis of international practice helped to develop this model, which joins accident indicators, road and traffic parameters. A cost-benefit analysis of the system, implemented on main road sections and selected by suggested model, shows a high level of payback.

The survey was part of a larger study that accompanied the introduction of digital speed cameras. Speed camera deployment started in 2011, and till the end of 2013 twenty-one cameras were deployed in interurban road sections. Yearly surveys were taken between 2010 and 2013 in 9 gas stations near speed camera installation sites in order to capture drivers' opinions about speed and enforcement. Overall, 1993 drivers were interviewed. In terms of admitted speed behavior, 38% of the drivers in 2010, 21% in 2011, 13% in 2012 and 11% in 2013 reported that their driving speed was above the perceived posted speed limit. The proportion of drivers indicating some speed camera influence on driving decreased over the years. In addition, the majority of drivers (61%) predicted positive impact of speed cameras on safety. This result did not change significantly over the years. The main stated explanation for speed limit violations was time pressure, while the main stated explanation for respecting the posted speed was enforcement, rather than safety concerns. Linear regression and sigmoidal models were applied to describe the linkage between the reported driving speed (dependent) and the perceived posted speed (independent). The sigmoidal model fitted the data better, especially at high levels of the perceived posted speeds. That is, although the perceived posted speed increased, at some point the actual driving speed levels off (asymptote) and did not increase. Moreover, we found that the upper asymptote of the sigmoidal model decreased over the years: from 113.22 (SE = 18.84) km/h in 2010 to 88.92 (SE = 1.55) km/h in 2013. A wide variance in perceived speed limits suggest that drivers may not know what the speed limits really are. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

The paper is based on a game-theoretic model of how the rate of violations and the amount of enforcement is determined by the interaction between drivers and the police. This model makes predictions both about how drivers will adapt to changes in the amount of enforcement (the more enforcement, the less violations) as well as how the police will adapt to changes in the rate of violations (the less violations, the less enforcement). The paper attempts to test the game-theoretic model empirically. Testing the model rigorously is difficult, mainly because some of the relevant variables are not reliably measured and are endogenous. Two models were developed: one to identify sources of changes in the rate of violations, one to identify sources of changes in the amount of enforcement. The predictions of the game-theoretic model were supported, although the results were not statistically significant in the model of how the police adapt enforcement to changes in the rate of violations. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Key factors associated with worse prognosis were identified. We proposed some measures that may be implemented to reduce the frequency and severity of such accidents. METHODS This was a retrospective study of RTAs involving children aged 0-16 years who presented to the Children’s Emergency at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital, Singapore, from January 2011 to June 2014. Data was obtained from the National Trauma Registry and analysed in tiers based on the Injury Severity Score (ISS). RESULTS A total of 1,243 accidents were reviewed. RTA victims included motor vehicle passengers (60.4%), pedestrians (28.5%), cyclists (9.9%) and motorcycle pillion riders (1.2%). The disposition of emergency department (ED) patients was consistent with RTA severity. For serious RTAs, pedestrians accounted for 63.6% and 57.7% of Tier 1 (ISS > 15) and Tier 2 (ISS 9-15) presentations, respectively. Overall use of restraints was worryingly low (36.7%). Not restraining increased the risk of serious RTAs by 8.4 times. Young age, high ISS and low Glasgow Coma Scale score predicted a longer duration of intensive care unit stay. CONCLUSION The importance of restraints for motor vehicle passengers or helmets for motorcycle pillion riders and cyclists in reducing morbidity requires emphasis. Suggestions for future prevention and intervention include road safety education, regulation of protective restraints, use of speed enforcement devices and creation of transport policies that minimise kerbside parking. © 2018, Singapore Medical Association.

Accordingly, it has been argued that stricter speed enforcement thresholds could further improve road safety. Effective speed monitoring however requires driver attention and effort, and human information-processing capacity is limited. Emphasizing speed monitoring may therefore reduce resource availability for other aspects of safe vehicle operation. We investigated whether lowering enforcement thresholds in a simulator setting would introduce further competition for limited cognitive and visual resources. Eighty-four young adult participants drove under conditions where they could be fined for travelling 1, 6, or 11 km/h over a 50 km/h speed-limit. Stricter speed enforcement led to greater subjective workload and significant decrements in peripheral object detection. These data indicate that the benefits of reduced speeding with stricter enforcement may be at least partially offset by greater mental demands on drivers, reducing their responses to safety-critical stimuli on the road. It is likely these results under-estimate the impact of stricter speed enforcement on real-world drivers who experience significantly greater pressures to drive at or above the speed limit. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd"

This paper contributes to this topic in two ways. The first step describes a comprehensive methodology for identifying hot spots road segments and corridors with problems of GHG emissions to enable low-carbon actions. The Highway Energy Assessment (HERA) methodology is applied to the national road network of Spain in order to estimate interurban traffic emissions and calculate the emissions index to assess strategies. The results are shown graphically on a GIS, allowing to identify seven corridors with emissions problems comprising 25% of the network and being responsible for 51% of the total GHG emissions in 2012. Inefficient corridors were those with high rates of heavy vehicles, high speeds and steep gradients. The second step consists of the application of a set of strategies to reduce their emissions and their comparison to the reference scenario. The Mediterranean corridor-the most inefficient corridor-was selected to apply a set of abatement strategies. The most effective strategy was speed enforcement for light vehicles. A speed reduction of 10 km/h could produce a 3.5% savings in emissions compared to the reference scenarios, and decrease emissions intensity from 254 gCO2eq/veh-km to 246 gCO2eq/veh-km. © 2018 by the authors."

However, most previous research focuses mainly on validating the safety effects of MPE, with very minimal discussion on the enforcement performance indicators (EPIs). Therefore, the goal of this study is to provide a better understanding of the relationship between the three selected EPIs (number of enforced sites, average check length, and number of issued tickets) and the program's safety outcomes. In total, 8 years (2005–2012) of monthly citywide data were collected and used in a generalized linear Poisson model. The results show that as the number of enforced sites and issued tickets increased, the number of speed-related collisions decreased. Also, as the average check length decreased, a greater reduction of speed-related collisions was observed. These results indicate that collision reductions were associated with a MPE program that promoted: higher spatial coverage (i.e., more enforceable locations), more frequent checks (i.e., shorter average check length), and more issued tickets. The marginal effects of enforcing 100 sites and issuing 10,000 tickets per month were calculated to be 47 and 140 fewer speed-related collisions, respectively. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC and The University of Tennessee."

The program uses traditional manned police speed enforcement method, which are supplemented by traffic safety messages displayed on permanent and mobile dynamic messaging signs (DMS). In this paper, collision data analysis was performed by looking at the daily number of collisions from 2008 to 2011 that covers 28 Operation 24 Hours (OPS24) events. The objective of the collision data analysis is to analyze if there is a reduction in collision frequencies after OPS24 was held and examined how long the collision reduction effect last. Weather factors such as temperature, thickness of snow, and wind gust have been considered by many as a great influence on collision occurrences, especially in a city with long and cold winter such as Edmonton. Therefore, collision modeling was performed by considering these external weather factors. To analyze the linear and periodic trend of different collision types (injury, fatal, and property damage only (PDO)) and examine the influence of weather factors on collisions, negative binomial time series model that accounts for seasonality and weather factors was used to model daily collision data. The modeling also considered collision proportion to account for missing traffic volume data; the Gaussian time series model that accounts for seasonality and weather factors was used to model collision proportion. To estimate the collision trend and test for changes in collision levels before/after OPS24, interrupted time series model with segmented regression was used.

In this paper, a methodology, employing the radar speed gun, the video recorder, and the dynamic strain tester in combination with manually recording is used to continuously and detailed investigate the traffic loads on the expressway bridge within 24 hours a day. With this approach introduced by this paper, all the critical parameters, such as the vehicle type, speed, traffic lane, the arriving time of the traffic and the bridge-vehicle dynamic interaction are all recorded. In this investigation, firstly the dynamic responses of 8 pieces of beams of the bridge under 5650 individual vehicles driving through the bridge are recorded, secondly statistics analysis are made for the record of each beam, and finally the space-time distribution laws of the dynamic response of the bridge under the traffic flowing are studied extensively.

A comprehensive before-and-after analysis of the impact of the SEP on safety revealed significant reductions in crash frequency and severity, which indicates that the SEP is a promising countermeasure for improving safety. However, there is often a tradeoff between safety and mobility when safety investments are considered. As a result, identifying safety countermeasures that both improve safety and reduce Travel Time Variability (TTV) is a desirable goal for traffic safety engineers. This paper reports on the analysis of the mobility impacts of the SEP by simulating the traffic network with and without the SEP, calibrated to real world conditions. The simulation results show that the SEP decreased the TTV: the risk of unreliable travel was at least 23% higher in the ‘without SEP’ scenario than in the ‘with SEP’ scenario. In addition, the total Travel Time Savings (TTS) from the SEP was estimated to be at least ‘569 vehicle-hours/year.’ Consequently, the SEP is an efficient countermeasure not only for reducing crashes but also for improving mobility through TTS and reduced TTV. © 2011, Springer Verlag.

One way to adjust these behaviors is to enact and enforce legislation-based safety improvement measures (LSIMs). The objective of the project documented in this paper was to investigate the feasibility and application of a research-based rural safety policy improvement index (RSPII) framework that could be used to quantify the state-by-state impacts of LSIMs on crash fatalities on rural roadways. During this project, NCHRP Report 622 was published. It categorized 23 behavioral highway safety countermeasures as proven with high-quality research. A review of the research and NCHRP Report 622 showed that a RSPII was feasible. A six-step RSPII framework was developed, and six LSIMs were selected for further consideration: primary enforcement of seat belt use, universal motorcycle helmet use, regular application of sobriety checkpoints, graduated driver licensing program upgrades, mandatory ignition interlock installation, and automated speed enforcement. A state-by-state estimate (based on current research) of how enactment and proper implementation and enforcement of these LSIMs could reduce crash fatalities on rural roadways was completed. The national fatality reductions estimated for each LSIM ranged from 120 to 699. This paper describes the RSPII feasibility investigation, summarizes the six-step RSPII framework, presents the national results from the framework application, discusses the challenges related to the framework application, and gives recommendations for using and improving the RSPII framework."

This paper will recommend a method for designing Positive Train Control (PTC) systems to avoid the degradation of operating speeds, trip times and line capacities which is a frequent byproduct of train-control systems. One of the more significant operational impacts of PTC is expected to be similar to the impacts of enforcing civil speed restrictions by cab signaling, which is that the safe-braking rate used for signal-system design and which is expected to be used for PTC is significantly more conservative than the service brake rate of the train equipment and the deceleration rate used by train operators. This means that the enforced braking and speed reduction for any given curve speed restriction is initiated sooner than it otherwise would be by a human train operator, resulting in trains beginning to slow and/or reaching the target speed well in advance of where they would absent enforcement. This results in increased trip time, which can decrease track capacity. Another impact of speed enforcement is that it often results in ""underspeeding."" In a cab-signal (and manual-train- operation) environment, it has been well documented that train operators typically operate two or three mph below the nominal enforced speed to avoid the risk of penalty brake applications. Target and location speed enforcement under PTC is likely to foster the same behaviors unless the design is prepared to mitigate this phenomenon. While the trip-time and capacity impacts of earlier braking and train-operator underspeeding are generally marginal, that margin can be very significant in terms of incremental capacity and/or resource for recovery from minor perturbations (aka system reliability). The operational and design methodology that is discussed in this paper involves the use of a higher unbalance (cant deficiency) for calculating the safety speed of each curve that is to be enforced by PTC, while retaining the existing maximum unbalance standard and existing speed limits as ""timetable speed restrictions"". Train operators will continue to be held responsible for observing the timetable speed limits, while the PTC system would stand ready to enforce the higher safety speeds and unbalance should the train operator fail to properly control his or her train. The paper will present a potential methodology for calculating safety speeds that are in excess of the normal operating speeds. The paper will also calculate using TPC software the trip-time tradeoffs for using or not using this potential concept, for which there are some significant precedents. Other operational impacts, and proposed remedies, will be discussed as well. These will include the issues of total speed enforcement versus safety-speed enforcement, the ability of a railroad's management to perform the speed checks required by the FRA regulations under normal conditions, and the operation of trains under occasional but expected PTC failures. © 2010 by ASME."

This paper examined the safety impacts of Red Light Cameras (RLCs) on traffic crashes at signalized intersections using the Empirical Bayes (EB) method. Data were obtained from the Florida Department of Transportation for twenty-five RLC equipped intersections in Orange County, Florida. Additional fifty intersections that remained with no photo enforcement in the vicinity of the treated sites were collected to examine the spillover effects on the same corridors. The safety evaluation was performed at three main levels; only target approaches where RLCs were installed, all approaches on RLC intersections, and non-RLC intersections located on the same travel corridors as the camera equipped intersections. Moreover, the spatial spillover effects of RLCs were also examined on an aggregate level to evaluate the safety impacts on driver behavior at a regional scale. The results from this study indicated that there was a consistent significant reduction in angle and left-turn crashes and a significant increase in rear-end crashes on target approaches, in addition, the magnitude and the direction of these effects, to a lesser degree, were found similar on the whole intersection. Similar trends in shift of crash types were spilled-over to non-RLC intersections in the proximity of the treated sites. On an aggregate county level, there was a moderate spillover benefits with a notable crash migration to the boundary of the county. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd."

The portion of license plates that can be correctly recognized and matched at two separate stations is typically in the range of 35% or less. Existing methods for improving the matching of plates recognized by LPR units rely on intensive manual data reduction, such that the misread plates are manually entered into the system. Recently, an advanced matching technique that combines Bayesian probability and Levenshtein text-mining techniques was proposed to increase the accuracy of automated license plate matching. The key component of this method is what we called the association matrix, which contains the conditional probabilities of observing one character at one station for a given observed character at another station. However, the estimation of the association matrix relies on the manually extracted ground truth of a large number of plates, which is a cumbersome and tedious process. To overcome this drawback, in this study, we propose an ingenious novel self-learning algorithm that eliminates the need for extracting ground truth manually. These automatically learned association matrices are found to perform well in the correctness in plate matching, in comparison with those generated from the painstaking manual method. Furthermore, these automatically learned association matrices outperform their manual counterparts in reducing false matching rates. The automatic self-learning method is also cheaper and easier to implement and continues to improve and correct itself over time. © 2013 IEEE."

The automated section speed enforcement system is increasingly being used as an effective way to tackle speeding, especially on motorways and in tunnels. However, the effects on traffic flow patterns of such systems remain controversial. An empirical analysis of traffic flow patterns before and after the introduction of such a system along a freeway section with recurrent congestion is presented. Gathered data consisted of point measurements at detectors and average travel speeds of each vehicle crossing the stretch. The main observed features were (a) a strong homogenization of individual speeds and of mean speeds among the lanes, (b) a reduction in the strength of the bottleneck, (c) the emergence of significant oscillations in time of traffic characteristics, and (d) a sensible reduction of travel times during the congestion pattern caused by the bottleneck moving down-stream of the section. Empirical evidence suggests that driver compliance with speed limits is the key factor in analysis of such speed management systems and that their concurrent application with dynamic speed limit strategies should be thoroughly evaluated with a particular focus on this measure."

A multivariate logistic regression model revealed five independent factors for higher speeds on slopes: younger age, male gender, skier, higher skill level, and riskier behaviour. Helmet use is not associated with higher speeds on slopes. Therefore, ski helmets have been recommended because helmet use is associated with a considerable reduction of head injury risk. In general, to avoid speed related injuries, preventive recommendations include skiing under speed control consistent with the individual skiing ability, and slope and weather conditions. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart."

The base data were collected when signage typical of that shown in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for an Interstate highway work zone with no lane reduction was present. Police and SPE data were collected, respectively, when a police patrol car and an SPE van were added to the typical work zone. From each data set, the step-by-step progression from a three-regime model based on least-squares regression to a four-regime speed-flow curve is presented. The four-regime model comprises four equations: (a) horizontal line for free-flow regime that covered the volume levels up to 900 passenger cars per hour per lane, (b) fourth-degree spline for the upper transition part of the speed-flow curve, (c) another fourth-degree spline for the lower transitions part, and (d) equation in the form of power function for the highly congested part of the speed-flow relationship. The speed-flow curve for the base case had a free-flow speed (FFS) of 61.3 mph and a capacity of 1,850 per car per hour per lane (pcphpl). In the police case, however, the FFS and capacity were reduced by 6.3 mph and 50 pcphpl, respectively. For the SPE case, the FFS and capacity were also reduced by 6.8 mph and 100 pcphpl, respectively. The new curves provided the more accurate speed and work zone capacity estimations required for efficient operation."

Despite existing evidence that males ski significantly faster than females, no sex-specific factor was inserted into the ISO 11088 standard. Objective: To evaluate factors potentially associated with the perception of individual skiing speed among recreational skiers. Methods: Skiing speeds of 416 adult skiers (62% males,) were measured with a radar speed gun. Skiers were interviewed about their age, sex, skill level, risk taking behaviour and helmet use. Finally, skiers had to rate their perceived speed on one out of three speed categories (fast, moderate, slow). Results: The measured mean speed of this cohort was 48.2±14.3 km/h (30.0±8.9 mph). A total of 32%, 52%, and 16% of skiers perceived their actual speed as fast, moderate and slow, respectively. Mean speed differed significantly between the 3 speed categories with a mean of about 53.5±13.7 km/h (33.2±8.5 mph) for fast, 47.6±14.0 km/h (29.6±8.7 mph) for moderate, and 39.4±12.2 km/h (24.5±7.6 mph) for slow skiing, respectively. Sex (η2 = .074), skill level (η2 = .035) and risk taking behavior (η2 = .033) showed significant differences of skiing speeds with regard to the 3 categories of speed perception (all p < .001) while age groups and ski helmet use did not. Males, more skilled skiers and risky skiers perceived their actual speed as fast, moderate and slow, when skiing up to 10 km/h (6 mph) faster compared to females, less skilled and cautious skiers. Conclusion: The perception of skiing speed as fast, moderate or slow depends on sex, skill level, and risk taking behaviour. These findings should be considered when discussing the introduction of a sex factor into the ISO 11088 standard for setting binding release values. © 2015 Brunner et al.

Drawing on theories of police legitimacy, we hypothesize the label will result in an abrupt-permanent increase in speeding citation contestation rates, despite the fact that the billboard actually increases predictability of citation issuance. Results of an interrupted time-series analysis indicate statistically significant abrupt-permanent increases in the speeding citation contestation rates for the intervention city.

Likewise, many past studies investigated the effects of ITS implementation on vehicle speeds in freeway work zones. However, the effects of police enforcement and ITS implementation on work zone traffic flow characteristics and capacity have not yet been extensively studied. Hence, this study investigates the distinct effects of police enforcement and ITS implementation on work zone speed-flow curve and capacity. Three sets of traffic data were collected in a two-lane-open work zone located on I-55 near Chicago. The first data set was collected when there was only the traditional Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) signage in the work zone. The second and the third data sets were collected when there was additionally police enforcement and Speed Photo Enforcement (SPE) in the work zone, respectively. The results showed that both the police enforcement and SPE led to significant changes in the work zone speed-flow curve compared to only MUTCD signage conditions. The general shape of the speed-flow relationship inside the work zone was similar to the speed-flow curve under basic freeway conditions, but the bending point of the upper branch of the curve occurred at lower traffic flow rates and the rate of the decrease in speed was higher. The speed-flow curve for the MUTCD signage-only case returned a work zone capacity of around 1,850 passenger cars per hour per lane (pcphpl). Compared to that speed-flow curve, both the police enforcement and SPE moved the upper (uncongested) branch of the speed-flow curve downward, which caused a work zone capacity reduction of about 50 pcphpl in the case of police enforcement and 100 pcphpl in the case of SPE implementation. The results obtained through this study reveals the distinct effects of police enforcement and ITS on work zone capacity. Accurately estimating the capacity of work zones with different speed reduction treatments provides more efficient operation in a real-time system, more accurate diversion and traveler information for alternate routing, improved reliability of the system, and better understanding of the traffic flow characteristics in work zones. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd."

Methods: Truck crashes were analyzed to identify how truck traffic safety is related to prevailing traffic and weather conditions. Prevailing traffic conditions were characterized by central tendencies and the spatiotemporal variation of traffic parameters collected from freeway traffic surveillance systems. A total of 377 truck crashes occurring on Korean freeways in a recent 3-year period, 2008-2010, were analyzed together with corresponding prevailing traffic conditions and weather conditions. Several statistical tests were conducted to understand the characteristics of prevailing traffic conditions before crash occurrence based on different weather conditions. In addition, a binary logistic regression technique was applied to identify causal factors affecting truck crash severity under normal and adverse weather conditions. Results: Major findings from the analyses are discussed with truck operations strategies including speed enforcement, variable speed limit, and truck lane restriction from the safety enhancement point of view. Speed-related variables representing prevailing traffic conditions before crash occurrences were found to be the most statistically significant factors affecting truck crash severity, compared to volume-related variables such as the volume-to-capacity ratio (v/c). It is inferred that speed management is an effective tool for safer truck traffic operations on freeways. The major findings can be further discussed to derive valuable insights into truck traffic operations based on different weather conditions, such as normal and adverse. Conclusions: Some recommendations for safer truck traffic operations were presented based on the results obtained. The outcomes of this study could be effectively utilized to support the development of various traffic operations strategies and policies for truck traffic safety.

For promoting road safety in France, an automatic speed enforcement (ASE) system was introduced late 2002. Objective In order to examine its efficiency on speeding and its motivations, we compared young drivers' intentions and beliefs about speeding between the introduction of ASE (T1) and its completion in 2005 (T2) via a large survey based on the extended Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). We assumed the introduction of the ASE would covariate with a reduction in intention to speeding between T1 and T2 and a change in the extended TPB factors according to gender and driving experience. Method One thousand one hundred and ninety-two young participants (49.7% men) divided into novice, beginner, and more-experienced drivers filled in a questionnaire based on the extended TPB about their driving behaviour and history at T1 and 24 months later (T2). Results Men, beginner and more-experienced drivers expressed more intention to speeding within the next 12 months at T1 and showed a higher decrease in intention between T1 and T2 as compared to women and novice drivers. The extended TPB accounted for 59% of the variance in the decrease of the intention to speeding. Its main predictors were: lower perceived behavioural control over speeding, less social pressure, lower perceived similarity with the prototypical deviant driver, and higher comparative optimism. Secondly, slightly more positive behavioural beliefs and more negative outcome evaluations predicted this decrease.

ARIMA time series analyses regarding crashes related to red-light running (right-angle crashes and rear-end crashes) and crashes related to speeding (injury crashes and property damage only crashes) occurring at intersections were conducted using monthly crash counts from 1994 to 2008. A quasi-experimental intersection camera experiment was also conducted using roadside data on speeding and red-light running behavior at intersections. These data were analyzed using logistic regression analysis. The time series analyses showed that for crashes related to red-light running, there had been a 46% decrease in right-angle crashes at camera intersections, but that there had also been an initial 42% increase in rear-end crashes. For crashes related to speeding, analyses revealed that the installation of cameras was not associated with increases or decreases in crashes. Results of the intersection camera experiment show that there were significantly fewer red light running violations at intersections after installation of cameras and that photo enforcement had a protective effect on speeding behavior at intersections. However, the data also suggest photo enforcement may be less effective in preventing serious speeding violations at intersections. Overall, Winnipeg's photo enforcement safety program had a positive net effect on traffic safety. Results from both the ARIMA time series and the quasi-experimental design corroborate one another. However, the protective effect of photo enforcement is not equally pronounced across different conditions so further monitoring is required to improve the delivery of this measure.

SEPTA will be implementing ACSES (Advanced Civil Speed Enforcement System), originally introduced on Amtrak on portions of the Northeast Corridor (NEC), as an overlay system applied upon a base of Automatic Train Control (ATC) cab signaling. Every SEPTA train travels on Amtrak territory as a ""tenant"" at some time during its daily run, and consequently ACSES is required for interoperable PTC operation on Amtrak. The application of ACSES on SEPTA territory will be complemented by a simultaneous upgrading of existing and new ATC on SEPTA. Among the many decisions faced by the SEPTA PTC design team, the PTC communications systems design has proven to be challenging. The communications systems include digital radios, communications managers, ground based networks, office systems, network management and network security. Some elements have been designed from the ground up, with few commercial ""off the shelf"" components available to meet the design requirements. Moreover, SEPTA had limited 220 MHz spectrum available for a PTC radio network in a relatively compact geographic area of dense commuter rail traffic. The radio network and communications managers, in particular, are breaking new ground for U.S. commuter rail operations with adoption of Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) digital packet radios operating in the 220 MHz spectrum, under the control of communications managers.

Conversely, motorcycle performance capability may influence the likelihood of risky driving behaviors such as speeding. Both mechanisms may affect fatal crash risk when examined by motorcycle type. Although it was not possible to estimate the effect of each mechanism, the current study analyzed fatal crash data for evidence of motorcycle type differences in risky driving behaviors and risk of driver death. Methods: Street legal motorcycles were classified into 10 types based on design characteristics and then further grouped as cruiser/standard, touring, sport touring, sport/unclad sport, supersport, and all others. For each motorcycle type, driver death rates per 10,000 registered vehicle years and the prevalence of fatal crash characteristics such as speeding were analyzed. Differences among motorcycle types concerning the effect of engine displacement were examined using Poisson regression. Results: Overall, driver death rates for supersport motorcycles were four times as high as those for cruiser/standard motorcycles. Fatally injured supersport drivers were most likely to have been speeding and most likely to have worn helmets, but least likely to have been impaired by alcohol compared with drivers of other motorcycle types. The patterns in driver factors held after accounting for the effects of age and gender. Increased engine displacement was associated with higher driver death rates for each motorcycle type. Conclusion: Strong effects of motorcycle type were observed on driver death rates and on the likelihood of risky driving behaviors such as speeding and alcohol impairment. Although the current study could not completely disentangle the effects of motorcycle type and rider characteristics such as age on driver death rates, the effects of both motorcycle type and rider age on the likelihood of risky driving behaviors were observed among fatally injured motorcycle drivers. Impact on Industry: Certain motorcycle designs, particularly supersport motorcycles, are associated with increases in risky driving behaviors and higher driver death rates. At present, there are no proven countermeasures for this situation. However, existing countermeasures such as helmet laws and automated speed enforcement could have a substantial benefit. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd."

Statistics show that approximately 45 percent of crashes at intersections caused by red light running result in severe injuries and fatalities, while only approximately 30 percent of all other types of intersection crashes cause injuries or fatalities. Over the past decade, many US cities and counties have deployed red light running photo enforcement systems for signalized intersections within their jurisdictions to potentially reduce red light running related crashes. This study proposes an empirical Bayesian (EB) before-after analysis method that computes a weighed sum of crashes observed in the field and crashes predicted by safety performance functions (SPFs) to mitigate regression-to-mean biases for analyzing crash reduction effects of red light running enforcement. The analysis explicitly considers red light running related crash types, including head-on, rear-end, angle, turning, sideswipe in the same direction, and sideswipe in the opposite direction; and crash severity levels classified as fatal, injury, and property damage only (PDO). A computational study is conducted to examine the effectiveness of the Chicago program with red light running photo enforcement systems deployed for nearly two hundred signalized intersections. It is revealed that the use of red light running photo enforcement on the whole is positive, as demonstrated by reductions in all types of fatal crashes by 4–48 percent, and injury-related angle crashes by 1 percent. However, it slightly raises PDO-related angle crashes and moderately increases injury and PDO related rear-end crashes. The safety effectiveness of red light running photo enforcement is sensitive to intersection location. © 2014 Periodical Offices of Chang'an University"

The antenna beamwidths in vertical and horizontal directions are critical parameters for AbTR radar because speed measurement accuracy partly depends on vertical beamwidth and speed measurement interference from adjacent lanes can be effectively minimized by appropriate choice of horizontal beamwidth. In this paper, the speed measurement principle of AbTR radar is introduced and the reason for field speed measurement error is presented. The speed measurement error is theoretically calculated in various combinations of different vertical beamwidths and possible installation angles. The requirement for horizontal beamwidth to operate with less interference from adjacent lanes is also theoretically laid down with different installation heights and angles. Field tests with three equal-distanced piezosensors each lane as triggering references have been performed on an AbTR radar sample with vertical beamwidth 5.1 and horizontal beamwidth 5.2. The results of theoretical analysis and field tests validate that the requirement of less than 6 for AbTR radar antenna beamwidths in vertical and horizontal directions is a precondition for accurate and reliable field measurements, which has been added to the Chinas pattern approval regulation for AbTR radar devices newly published.

An appropriate speed limit is the critical determinant for automated speed photo enforcement, but this has rarely been explored. Hence, this study attempts to investigate the speeds of vehicles entering the intersection after yellow onset. Data used for the analysis were collected via field observation from eleven high-speed signalized intersections in Harbin, China. Statistical hypothesis testing was performed. The results show that entry speeds are lower than the posted speed limit and follow normal distribution with a unimodal curve. The posted speed limit, through lane number, land position and width, vehicle type, peak period, and free flow condition significantly impact entry speed. These findings imply that setting up a speed limit for preventing deliberately violating yellow light should consider the entry speed and its influential factors. © ASCE."

The down-the-road radar has been used to provide speed feedback to motorists and give them an opportunity to reduce their speeds. The across-the-road radar measures the speed of the vehicles when they are about 150 feet (ft.) upstream of the van, and if the measured speed exceeds a certain threshold, two photographs of the violating vehicle are taken. SPE reduces the average speeds of heavy vehicles significantly below the speed limit level (55 mph) on both lanes. The average speeds of free-flow heavy vehicles ranged from 44.8 mph to 52.2 mph, and the speed reductions ranged from 3.4 mph to 7 mph.

These are typically unattended fielded systems, and so it is important to periodically check them for potential image/video quality problems that might interfere with their intended functionality. There is interest in automating such checks to reduce the operational overhead and human error involved in manually checking large camera device fleets. Examples of problems affecting such camera devices include exposure issues, focus drifts, obstructions, misalignment, download errors, and motion blur. Furthermore, in some cases, in addition to the sub-algorithms for individual problems, one also has to carefully design the overall algorithm and logic to check for and accurately classifying these individual problems. Some of these issues can occur in tandem or have the potential to be confused for each other by automated algorithms. Examples include camera misalignment that can cause some scene elements to go out of focus for wide-area scenes or download errors that can be misinterpreted as an obstruction. Therefore, the sequence in which the sub-algorithms are utilized is also important.

It is also widely acknowledged that speed levels affect pollutant emissions. Therefore, significant co-benefits in environment and road safety are expected from the application of such systems. Yet few studies have investigated the environmental effects of speed limit reduction and even fewer those of tight speed limit enforcement. In this study an empirical analysis is carried out to investigate the impact of a new 80km/h speed limit and tight enforcement on an urban motorway in Italy. First a detailed analysis of individual-vehicle section speeds (i.e. section travel times) is performed. The study focuses on seven motorway sections and three reference periods, namely weekday peak hours, free-flow hours and the entire week. This allows the effect of road geometry and traffic conditions to be evaluated as well. Secondly, thorough calculation of pollutant emissions and fuel consumption is carried out. As it is based on individual vehicle speeds, the effect of changes in speed variance among drivers is also captured. This turned out to be relevant to the application. Basically, study outcomes suggest that the strategy can be a straightforward and effective policy to put eco-driving principles into practice, only in network stretches or in time periods in which congestion is not too heavy. Therefore, for such systems the opportunity for significant co-benefits in fuel economy and road safety appears to exist only under these strict conditions."

By means of two examples, we illustrate the distinction between a project of increased/improved enforcement of existing speed limits, where violators' time losses should not be included - compatible with Elvik's point of view - and a project of reduced speed limits, where the time loss should be included.

To capture potential spillover effects of cameras, control groups at various distances from the intersections with cameras are considered. A Poisson panel data model with random coefficients is applied to these data and estimated using Bayesian methods. The program suffered from weaknesses in enforcement. The city's courts did not uphold citations and this dampened the effect cameras had on drivers. These problems are accounted for in modeling.

The main drawback for the wider usage of such satellites is their high cost of launching into their orbit. As alternatives to conventional rocket launching, launching by high muzzle speed guns or by electric railguns have been proposed. However, it is hereby advocated that aerostats, stratospheric or mesospheric balloons tethered to a fixed point on the earth can also be used to fulfil the same tasks within a limited area of coverage. However, it is possible to widen the area of coverage by using a constellation of such balloons, presumably at a fraction of the cost of satellite launching. Presently, aerostats at about a few kilometers height are being used for a number of purposes, including border monitoring. The idea of tethered balloons reaching the lower parts of the stratosphere has been studied in 1960's for atmospheric research and successful results from prototype balloons have been obtained. The main problem related to high altitude aerostats has been found that extreme drifting loads are being induced by high altitude winds during the ascent (launching) and descent (recovery) phases. In the light of development of new high performance materials, as well as the development of superpressure balloons, it is now proposed to re-consider the same concept as a platform for high altitude devices used for communications, media broadcasting, environmental monitoring via optical or SAR imagery, monitoring for border security and illegal trafficking. Also, the possibility of two stage launching, ie, launching an aerostat from a high altitude airship shall be addressed. It is considered that the most convenient altitude for such aerostats is the stratopause region, with pressures at the order of 1 hPa pressure or 48 000-50 000 meters above the sea level. © 2011 IEEE."

The results indicated that the mean headway of cars in the median lane significantly increased in both work zones when the SPE van was present compared to the base condition. For trucks, the mean headway increase was significant only in the shoulder lane when the SPE was present.

Different tools are available to governments' intent on making drivers observe the Highway Code: educative measures, communication campaigns and rehabilitation programmes can be put into effect, whereas speed checking devices can help with enforcement of speed limits and punishment of offenders. The ultimate goal is to reduce the number of fatalities and injuries on the roads. Many changes have taken place in France since 2000 and impressive results have been obtained during the last decade, with road fatalities decreasing by 40%. Thousands of deaths and injuries have been avoided. The outstanding factor here is the implementation of an automated speed enforcement programme (ASEP). However, other important changes have also taken place and 2000-2009 has been a decade of real evolution for speed enforcement policy in France. This contribution proposes to investigate the nature of the changes which occurred during the last decade with regard to speed enforcement: new legislation, political commitment and the implementation of an ASEP. The second section investigates the modalities of this change in speed enforcement activities: modification of organisation of speed enforcement, evolution of speed offences and the implications for manual speed checks. The last section is concerned with the consequences of these changes: evolution of driving speeds and speeding behaviour."

The authors examined traffic injuries in Qatar during 2000e2010, a period of rapid population growth, focusing on the impact of speed control cameras installed in 2007 on overall injury rates and mortality. During the period 2000e2006, prior to camera installation, the mean (SD) vehicular injury death rate per 100 000 was 19.9±4.1. From 2007 to 2010, the mean (SD) vehicular death rates were significantly lower: 14.7±1.5 (p=0.028). Non-fatal severe injury rates also declined, but mild injury rates increased, perhaps because of increased traffic congestion and improved notification. It is possible that speed cameras decreased speeding enough to affect the death rate, without affecting overall injury rates. These data suggest that in a rapidly growing Middle Eastern country, photo enforcement (speed) cameras can be an important component of traffic control, but other measures will be required for maximum impact."

The manner in which specific deterrence can influence recidivist behaviour can be conceptualised in different ways. While any reduction in speeding will have road safety benefits, the ways in which a 'reduction' is determined deserves greater methodological attention and has implications for countermeasure evaluation more generally. The primary aim of this research was to assess the specific deterrent impact of penalty increases for speeding offences in Queensland, Australia, in 2003 on two cohorts of drivers detected for speeding prior to and after the penalty changes were investigated. Since the literature is relatively silent on how to assess recidivism in the speeding context, the secondary research aim was to contribute to the literature regarding ways to conceptualise and measure specific deterrence in the speeding context. We propose a novel way of operationalising four measures which reflect different ways in which a specific deterrence effect could be conceptualised: (1) the proportion of offenders who re-offended in the follow up period; (2) the overall frequency of re-offending in the follow up period; (3) the length of delay to re-offence among those who re-offended; and (4) the average number of re-offences during the follow up period among those who re-offended. Consistent with expectations, results suggested an absolute deterrent effect of penalty changes, as evidenced by significant reductions in the proportion of drivers who re-offended and the overall frequency of re-offending, although effect sizes were small. Contrary to expectations, however, there was no evidence of a marginal specific deterrent effect among those who re-offended, with a significant reduction in the length of time to re-offence and no significant change in the average number of offences committed. Additional exploratory analyses investigating potential influences of the severity of the index offence, offence history, and method of detection revealed mixed results. Access to additional data from various sources suggested that the main findings were not influenced by changes in speed enforcement activity, public awareness of penalty changes, or driving exposure during the study period. Study limitations and recommendations for future research are discussed with a view to promoting more extensive evaluations of penalty changes and better understanding of how such changes may impact on motorists' perceptions of enforcement and sanctions, as well as on recidivist behaviour. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In these fielded systems, a variety of factors can cause camera obstructions and persistent view changes that may adversely affect their performance. Examples include camera misalignment, intentional blockage resulting from vandalism, and natural elements causing obstruction, such as foliage growing into the scene and ice forming on the porthole. In addition, other persistent view changes resulting from new scene elements of interest being captured, such as stalled cars, suspicious packages, etc. might warrant alarms. Since these systems are often unattended, it is often important to automatically detect such incidents early. In this paper, we describe innovative algorithms to address these problems. A novel approach that uses the image edge map to detect near-field obstructions without a reference image of the unobstructed scene is presented. A second algorithm that can be used to detect more generic obstructions and persistent view changes using a learned scene element cluster map is then discussed. Lastly, an approach to detect and distinguish persistent view changes from changes in the orientation of the fixed camera system is explained. Together, these algorithms can be useful in a variety of camera-based ITS. © 2012 IEEE."

The aim was to determine whether players could accurately judge if their serve was faster or slower than their preceding serve (experiment 1) and if providing them with accurate augmented KR feedback on service speed using a speed gun could enhance learning after training (experiment 2). Methods: In experiment 1, 11 high-level national junior players served 10 serves to a target area and were asked to judge whether the serve was faster/slower that the preceding serve. In experiment 2, 12 high-level national junior players, divided into two groups, trained to improve their service speed for 12 wk (three sessions per week). During the first 6 wk (90 maximum-effort serves/session), they received either augmented (group 1) or no augmented (group 2) KR feedback. During the following 6 wk, participants did not complete the 90 serves per session and received no augmented KR feedback (retention test). Results: In experiment 1, players could not correctly determine whether serves were faster/slower than the preceding serve. In experiment 2, both groups significantly enhanced their service speed after the initial 6 wk of service training, but the enhancement was significantly greater (P = 0.01) in the augmented versus no augmented KR feedback group (0.84 ± 0.38 vs 0.22 ± 0.04 m•s). These enhancements were still evident during the retention test (P = 0.01). Conclusions: Players cannot accurately judge service speed, and by providing this information in the form of augmented feedback, a player can enhance the process of learning to serve faster with training. Players should therefore use augmented feedback on service speed when training to serve faster. © 2012 by the American College of Sports Medicine."

Speeding accounts for about 10% of fatalities, which represents a large decrease from a peak of 17.2% in 2004. Speeding has been addressed at a national level through the introduction of laws and procedural requirements in 2004, in provinces either across all road types or on motorways, and at city level. Typically, documentation of speed enforcement programmes has taken place when new technology (i.e. speed cameras) is introduced, and it is likely that many programmes have not been documented or widely reported. In particular, the national legislation of 2004 and its implementation was associated with a large reduction in fatalities attributed to speeding. In Guangdong Province, after using speed detection equipment, motorway fatalities due to speeding in 2005 decreased by 32.5% comparing with 2004. In Beijing, the number of traffic monitoring units which were used to photograph illegal traffic activities such as traffic light violations, speeding and using bus lanes illegally increased to 1958 by April 1, 2009, and in the future such automated enforcement will become the main means of enforcement, expected to account for 60% of all traffic enforcement in Beijing.

For this purpose, a field survey was carried out in real traffic conditions, unlike most related studies that are based on either questionnaire responses or driving simulator experiments. In particular, traffic data were recorded on a fourlane urban arterial segment by means of a video camera and a speed gun. Linear regression models were developed for the analysis of the effect of cell phone use and other variables on traffic speed and time/space headways. It was found that vehicle speed is increased for young drivers (aged 18-25 years), male drivers and taxi drivers, and decreased for older drivers (>55 years) and for drivers using their mobile phone while driving. Vehicle's time headways were not found to be affected by cell phone use. However, headspaces, estimated as the product of vehicle speed and time headways, were found to be decreased for drivers using their mobile phone, young drivers and older drivers. Moreover, headspaces increased with the difference in speed and in headway of the vehicle ahead. Overall, drivers between 25-55 years old are associated with larger space headways regardless of the use of mobile phone, possibly due to a combination of adequate driving experience and skills. Mobile phone use results in lower speeds, suggesting a driver's compensatory effect on the distraction caused by the mobile phone use, an effect also identified in previous research. This distraction is also reflected in the reduced space headways associated with cell phone use for all drivers. The reduction is more pronounced when the speed and headway difference between successive vehicles was not significant in the first place, as is the case for vehicle platoons."

When appropriately complemented with police enforcement, SFS can be an effective method for reducing speeds at a desired location. However, as reported in the literature, effectiveness of SFS is limited not only in regard to time after the deployment but also for distance. Therefore, a need exists to understand how far upstream and downstream of the SFS speed reductions are maintained. Through a unique data collection methodology, researchers obtained trajectories of free-flowing vehicles that approached an SFS, as well as trajectories of vehicles receding from the SFS. Trajectory data were used by researchers to determine the locations at which drivers willing to reduce their speed when approaching the SFS actually started the reduction. Downstream of the SFS, the distance at which drivers started increasing their speed after complying with the sign was also determined. Results showed the feasibility of determining the spatial effectiveness of SFS. By using the methods as presented, speed enforcement personnel can understand how drivers in an area of interest react to SFS and therefore can determine the best locations for SFS as well as the number of SFS that need to be deployed to achieve a speed reduction over a segment of road."

The study specifically sought answers to the following two questions: (a) How did drivers respond to ASE on rural highways where live speed enforcement is limited? (b) What was the spatial extent of the speed reduction effects of ASE on rural highways? The research team compared speed data collected at various distances from seven sites in the Nanjing area of China where speed cameras were deployed. It was found that ASE significantly reduced vehicle speeds and speed violations in the vicinity of the locations where the speed cameras were deployed. However, ASE was not an effective way to reduce vehicle speeds on road sections beyond the area of influence of the speed cameras. The speed profiles developed in this study showed that the area of influence of a speed camera on a rural highway was generally less than 1 km. Drivers usually started to decelerate about 300 to 400 m before the speed cameras and recovered their original speeds about 300 to 400 m after the speed cameras. The findings suggested that without supplementation with other live speed enforcement efforts, such as mobile or stationary police patrols, elimination of speed violations on rural highways by the use of ASE alone would be difficult. A more realistic solution would be to deploy speed cameras at preselected potentially hazardous locations, such as intersections and horizontal curves, to help reduce speed violations."

Traditionally, this task has been partially solved using radar and/or laser technologies and, more recently, using video-camera based systems. All these systems have significant shortcomings that have yet to be overcome. The main drawback of classical Doppler radar technology is that the velocity measurement fails when several vehicles are in the radars beam. Modern radar systems are able to measure speed and range between vehicle and radar. However, this is not enough to discriminate the lane where the vehicle is driving on. The limitation of several vehicles in the beam is overcome using laser technology. However, laser systems have another important limitation: They cannot measure the speed of several vehicles simultaneously. Novel video-camera systems, based on license plate identification, solve the previous drawbacks, but they have the problem that they can only measure average speed but never top-speed. This paper studies the feasibility of using an interferometric linear frequency modulated continuous wave radar to improve top-speed enforcement on roadways. Two different systems based on down-the-road and across-the-road radar configurations are presented. The main advantage of the proposed solutions is they can simultaneously measure speed, range, and lane of several vehicles, allowing the univocal identification of the offenders. A detailed analysis about the operation and accuracy of these solutions is reported. In addition, the feasibility of the proposed techniques has been demonstrated with simulations and real experiments using a Ka-band interferometric radar developed by our research group. © 2006 IEEE."

Speed limit violations are prevalent, even on motorways with speed cameras. A problem with speed camera enforcement is that some motorists brake before passing a camera location and then exceed the speed limit after passing. This sudden braking can cause dangerous situations, crashes, and traffic jams. Furthermore, safe operating speed is not achieved where there are no cameras, especially where enforcement is overt, as in Italy. A new technique to overcome these problems is an automated section speed enforcement system, Safety Tutor. Unlike conventional speed meters, which measure vehicle speed at one point, the new technique determines average speed over a long distance. This study evaluated the safety effectiveness of the Safety Tutor system installed on Italian Motorway A1 Milan-Naples in 2007. An empirical Bayes observational before-and-after study was performed. The estimate of the total crash reduction is 31.2%, with a lower 95% confidence limit of 24.3%. The greatest crash reductions were observed for severe crashes and crashes at curves. Reduction was 55.6% for severe crashes, 26.6% for nonsevere crashes, 43.4% at curves, and 28.4% at tangents. However, the system's effectiveness decreased over time. The crash reduction was 39.4% in the first semester after the system's activation and 18.7% in the fifth semester after activation. Results strongly support activation of the new automated system owing to highly significant and substantial safety effects. The decrease in system effectiveness over time may be correctible with higher levels of enforcement."

However, because drivers are alerted about enforcement via on-board navigation systems and roadside signs, they can avoid enforcement by momentarily reducing their speeds near ASES locations. This enforcement avoidance behavior (EAB) can induce sudden changes in speed near the enforcement locations and thereby increase risk of crash occurrence. In light of this situation, the present study evaluates the effects of ASES on traffic behavior and safety. An analysis of traffic data shows that drivers indeed diminish their speeds near enforcement locations, and accelerate shortly after passing the locations. To investigate how this behavior affects safety performance, this study, by using Empirical Bayes analysis with comparison groups, compares crash occurrences along a certain section before and after the installation of ASES. The comparative analysis shows that overall crash occurrence dropped by 7.6% on average near the enforcement locations, although the reduction was not significant. However, an average 11% non-significant increase in crash occurrence is also observed in the upstream segment, where enforcement is announced to drivers and traffic starts to diminish speed. The findings suggest that the sudden changes in traffic speed induced by EAB substantially negate the benefits of ASES. Therefore, modification of the design of current ASES is required to mitigate EAB and further improve the effectiveness of ASES. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved."

Moreover, the spatial spillover effects of RLCs were also examined on an aggregate level to evaluate the safety impacts on a regional scale. The results from this study indicated that there was a consistent significant reduction in angle and left-turn crashes and a significant increase in rear-end crashes on target approaches, in addition, the magnitude and the direction of these effects, to a lesser degree, were found similar on the whole intersection.

Locally developed safety performance functions and yearly calibration factors for different collision severities were obtained by using a reference group of urban arterial roads. The evaluation period covers 8 years. Collision records, deployment information, traffic counts, and road geometric data were collected. The results showed consistent reductions in different collision severities; the reductions ranged from 14% to 20%, with the highest reductions observed for severe collisions. The enforced segments were further categorized according to site selection criteria and deployment hours to examine the effect of enforcement on collision reduction. More reductions were found at segments that had more collisions during the before period and longer deployment hours. The study also compared the safety effects of continuous and discontinuous enforcement strategies on different arterials, and the analysis revealed that continuous enforcement achieved more reductions across all severities and types of collisions.

Speed cameras are one of the most common speed enforcement tools. Most of the speed cameras around the world are overt, but there is evidence that this can cause a ""kangaroo effect"" in driving patterns. One suggested alternative to prevent this kangaroo effect is the use of covert cameras. Another issue relevant to the effect of enforcement countermeasures on speeding is the timing of the fine. There is general agreement on the importance of the immediacy of the punishment, however, in the context of speed limit enforcement, implementing such immediate punishment is difficult. An immediate feedback that mediates the delay between the speed violation and getting a ticket is one possible solution. This study examines combinations of concealment and the timing of the fine in operating speed cameras in order to evaluate the most effective one in terms of enforcing speed limits. Using a driving simulator, the driving performance of the following four experimental groups was tested: (1) overt cameras with delayed feedback, (2) overt cameras with immediate feedback, (3) covert cameras with delayed feedback, and (4) covert cameras with immediate feedback. Each of the 58 participants drove in the same scenario on three different days. The results showed that both median speed and speed variance were higher with overt than with covert cameras. Moreover, implementing a covert camera system along with immediate feedback was more conducive to drivers maintaining steady speeds at the permitted levels from the very beginning. Finally, both 'overt cameras' groups exhibit a kangaroo effect throughout the entire experiment. It can be concluded that an implementation strategy consisting of covert speed cameras combined with immediate feedback to the offender is potentially an optimal way to motivate drivers to maintain speeds at the speed limit. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper reviews the evidence regarding the impact of this approach on vehicle speeds, crash rates and a number of additional road safety and public health outcomes. The economic and practical viability of the approach as a road safety countermeasure is also explored. A literature review, with an international scope, of both published and grey literature was conducted. There is a growing body of evidence to suggest a number of road safety benefits associated with average speed enforcement, including high rates of compliance with speed limits, reductions in average and 85th percentile speeds and reduced speed variability between vehicles. Moreover, the approach has been demonstrated to be particularly effective in reducing excessive speeding behaviour. Reductions in crash rates have also been reported in association with average speed enforcement, particularly in relation to fatal and serious injury crashes. In addition, the approach has been shown to improve traffic flow, reduce vehicle emissions and has also been associated with high levels of public acceptance. Average speed enforcement offers a greater network-wide approach to managing speeds that reduces the impact of time and distance halo effects associated with other automated speed enforcement approaches. Although comparatively expensive it represents a highly reliable approach to speed enforcement that produces considerable returns on investment through reduced social and economic costs associated with crashes. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Drivers' speeds on these roads were also sampled with a speed gun. The results showed large differences between speeds chosen for different driving purposes; the lowest speeds were chosen when the goal was economy and the highest when driving for fun. In addition, there were individual differences in speed preferences such that some drivers indicated that their usual speed was above what they believed was a safe speed while others indicated that they usually drove even slower than what they thought was safe. These differences may account for much of the speed heterogeneity observed in on-road behaviour. The results also showed that drivers' speed choices are highly influenced by their usual speeds, even more so than their beliefs regarding what constitutes a safe speed, which may help explain non-compliance with speed limits.

These technology shifts allow SafeZone to accurately measure speeds over a distance of 75 meters between cameras. This highly accurate distance-over-time measurement is made possible through the use of a new camera technology developed by the company. This 75 meter baseline makes it possible for a pair of SafeZone cameras to directly replace a fixed speed camera, creating a networked zone in place of a single speed trap. A major benefit of the SafeZone technology is that it is scalable unlike fixed-speed cameras, enabling a customer to start with a basic system of two cameras."

The class must be correct, which requires synchronizing concurrent accesses, and the class should pro- vide reasonable performance, which is difficult to realize in the presence of unnecessary synchronization. Validating the performance of a thread-safe class is challenging because it requires diverse workloads that use the class, because existing performance analysis techniques focus on individual bottleneck methods, and because reliably measuring the performance of concurrent executions is difficult. This paper presents Speed Gun, an automatic performance regression testing technique for thread-safe classes. The key idea is to generate multi-threaded performance tests and to com- pare two versions of a class with each other. The analysis notifies developers when changing a thread-safe class significantly influences the performance of clients of this class. An evaluation with 113 pairs of classes from popular Java projects shows that the analysis effectively identifies 13 performance differences, including performance regressions that the respective developers were not aware of.

The apprehension of offenders is therefore a key component needed to maximise the effectiveness of the speed camera programme and not solely as a means to raise revenue."

In particular, they need to remain functional in low ambient illumination conditions (nighttime and cloudy day situations) to enable identification of objects or persons involved in incidents being monitored or extracting relevant information. Over time, for installed camera systems in the field, several problems can develop, such as external flash unit failures, focus drifts, and exposure issues. Thus, it is important to periodically monitor the nighttime images/videos taken by the camera system to ensure nominal functionality. However, due to constantly changing scene elements, it is not practical to compare a historical reference image with an identical scene against current camera output to detect problems. To address this, we present image quality metrics that can be extracted without a nominal reference image and can be used to characterize these problems. These can be incorporated into algorithms that can enable automated camera diagnostics for intelligent transportation systems. © 2012 IEEE."

They go as far as driving over the differentiated speed limit of the lighter passenger vehicles used for private transport. This paper compares and evaluates improvements in their speed compliance using two renowned interventions: Automated Average Speed Enforcement (ASE), and auditory Intelligent Speed Adaptation (ISA). It also investigates the impact of each intervention on fuel consumption to provide an additional incentive to the most efficient intervention. The main finding was that for minibus taxis, ASE needs ISA as a supplementary intervention. It was discovered that the drivers showed little or no behavioural change while driving on the ASE route, while the introduction of the ISA system resulted in significant changes bringing violation frequencies down to 47.4% from 81.2% on the enforcement route. These behavioural changes also resulted in lower fuel consumption rates especially while the ISA system was active. However fuel economy did not seem to work as a self-regulatory incentive for speed compliance. © 2015 IEEE."

The function describes the percentage effect of enforcement on the number of injury accidents as a function of the relative change in the amount of enforcement. Thirteen studies that have evaluated the effects of different levels of enforcement, each containing between four and eight data points, were used as data source. A hypothesis regarding the shape of an accident modification function was formulated to help assess the plausibility of the estimated relationships. In the first stage of analysis, functions were fitted to the data points of each study by means of weighted regression analysis. Many of these functions were highly implausible and likely to be influenced by outlying data points and random variation. In the second stage of analysis, data from all studies except two were pooled and data points referring to identical or almost identical levels of enforcement were aggregated to reduce the influence of random variation. The number of data points was thus reduced from 63 to 15 and an accident modification function was fitted to the data points. The function was consistent with the hypothesis guiding the study. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd."

As a number of technologies have rapidly advanced, including photo enforcement, electronic tolling, vehicle-mile taxing, weigh-in-motion, and Connected Vehicle technologies, research examining the privacy implications of system applications has lagged. In a recent national survey to determine how state departments of transportation (DOTs) are meeting the privacy needs of the traveling public, it was determined that DOTs favor aggregating and masking data for protecting privacy of motorists while collecting travel times and speeds. For capturing video surveillance, abiding by legislation or agency policies was the preferred method of protecting privacy. Unfortunately, there are no national standards in the US for the privacy protection of travelers as most privacy information merely takes the form of poorly defined precepts. With the increasing use of ITS applications, which are becoming more interwoven into the US transportation grid, there is a need to develop a national policy and related standards to ensure the privacy protection of the traveling public to ensure broader acceptance of ITS applications.

Its technology allows vehicles whose average speed exceeds the speed limit over the controlled section to be fined. It therefore encourages compliance over distances longer than those where spot enforcement policies have been in place.In this paper, a procedure for consistently setting speed limits with such enforcement systems is proposed. Such a method has been applied to design the speed limits on two motorways in the district of Naples, Italy, where P2P enforcement systems became operational in 2009 and 2010. The speed limits, which were set using the Italian geometric design standard to assess vehicle stability and stopping sight distance, have been compared with those provided by using well-known international standards.The impact of the newly designed speed limits and of the P2P enforcement system on drivers' speeding behaviour has been quantified for each highway section and vehicle type. In fact, accurate measurements of the average travel speeds of each vehicle crossing the enforced sections, before and after the activation of the system, were available. The migration from the old speed limits with spot speed enforcement to the new approach resulted in a notable increase in drivers' compliance to the speed limits with a remarkable decrease in both the average of individual speeds and in their standard deviation.In addition, the analysis of 3. years of data shows that a gradual adaptation of drivers' behaviour to the system took place. In particular, a decreasing compliance to the speed limits points to a non-optimal system management. Finally, the results of a revealed preference survey allowed us to make a behavioural interpretation regarding the significantly different impacts measured on the two motorways. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd."

An opportunity presented itself to evaluate what would happen to red light running behavior at formerly enforced locations. Using intersections previously studied to document one city's deployment and use of photo enforcement (see Martinez and Porter, 2006), we mobilized multiple pre-expiration, immediate post-expiration, and one year post-expiration observations at camera-enforced intersections as well as two control groups consisting of same-city and a different city's non-camera locations. More than 2700 direct observations were made in these time periods, documenting the near-immediate increase in red light running at previously camera-enforced intersections. These intersections had a rate that nearly tripled immediately after the law expired, and more than quadrupled one year later. Further, within a year of the law's expiration, the low red light running rates at the previous-camera locations had recidivated to red light running rates of the control locations. Driver characteristics were not significant predictors of these rates once intersection group and traffic volume (and their interaction) were controlled, meaning red light running in this study was not linked to a particular driver type. Our results are important for scholars of intersection safety, as this is the first known peer-reviewed study documenting estimates of what could happen when automated enforcement is removed. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd."

The P2P speed enforcement is a relatively new approach to traffic law enforcement that involves the calculation of the average speed over a section. To evaluate the speed effects, we performed a before-after analysis of speed data investigating also effects on non-compliance to speed limits. To evaluate the safety effects, we carried out an empirical Bayes observational before-and-after study. The P2P system led to very positive effects on both speed and safety. As far as the effects on the section average travel speeds, the system yielded to a reduction in the mean speed, the 85th percentile speed, the standard deviation of speed, and the proportion of drivers exceeding the speed limits, exceeding the speed limits more than 10 km/h, and exceeding the speed limits more than 20 km/h. The best results were the decrease of the speed variability and the reduction of the excessive speeding behaviour. The decrease in the standard deviation of speed was 26% while the proportion of light and heavy vehicles exceeding the speed limits more than 20 km/h was reduced respectively by 84 and 77%. As far as the safety effects, the P2P system yielded to a 32% reduction in the total crashes, with a lower 95% confidence limit of the estimate equal to 22%. The greatest crash reductions were in rainy weather (57%), on wet pavement (51%), on curves (49%), for single vehicle crashes (44%), and for injury crashes (37%). It is noteworthy that the system produced a statistically significant reduction of 21% in total crashes also in the part of the motorway where it was not activated, thus generating a significant spillover effect. The investigation of the effects of the P2P system on speed and safety over time allowed to develop crash modification functions where the relationship between crash modification factors and speed parameters (mean speed, 85th percentile speed, and standard deviation of speed) was expressed by a power function. Crash modification functions show that the effect of speed on safety is greater on curves and for injury crashes. Even though the study results show excellent outcomes, we must point out that the crash reduction effects decreased over time and speed, speed variability, and non-compliance to speed limits significantly increased over time. To maintain its effectiveness over time, P2P speed enforcement must be actively managed, i.e. constantly monitored and supported by appropriate sanctions. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

In addition, when the headway between two vehicles is less than the follower's reaction time, a rear end collision is likely to happen if the leader suddenly decreases its speed. In this paper, the effects of the SPE on the headway of vehicles traveling along a work zone are studied. For this purpose, we collected data from two locations that were around 1.5 miles apart in a work zone on interstate highway 55 at. The SPE van was present at the upstream location. The headway of all vehicles within a period of 45 minutes was measured at the upstream location as well as the downstream location. The results of this study showed that the presence of the SPE did not reduce the headway of the traffic stream at the location that it was present, as well as at the downstream location. This was confirmed by comparing the headway of followers (headway less than four seconds) when the SPE was deployed in the work zone to the headway of them when the SPE was not present, for both lanes combined, and for the shoulder and median lanes separately. The same result was observed for different pairs of leaders and followers. In addition, our analysis showed that the SPE prevented a reduction in the headway of car-car pairs traveling on the median lane at the downstream location. © 2011 ASCE."

They are the fourth leading cause of premature death in the country and are responsible for 2.4% of the burden of non-fatal health loss in the country. Interventions to curb speeding and drink driving are being implemented in the cities of Suzhou and Dalian since late 2010. We evaluated the ongoing effect of these activities through five roadside surveys, seven rounds of observational studies, and analysis of crash statistics in the two cities. We find that thus far, the prevalence of speeding has not reduced in either city with the notable exception of one site in Dalian, where the percentage of speeding vehicles declined from nearly 70% to below 10% after an interval-based speed enforcement system was installed. The broader deployment of such speed control technologies across China and other countries should be explored. Roadside alcohol testing suggests that prevalence of drink driving prevalence (i.e. BAC >20 mg%) declined from 6.4% to 0.5% in Suzhou and from 1.7% to 0.7% in Dalian during the monitored time period. However, the measured prevalence rates are very low and should be validated against estimates based on hospital studies. Roadside interviews suggest that the population of both cities is already highly sensitized to the risks associated with drink driving and speeding. Crash statistics from the two cities do not show appreciable declines in injuries and fatalities as yet. However, the possibility of substantial underreporting in crash statistics sourced from traffic police poses a severe threat to monitoring progress towards road safety in Suzhou, Dalian and across China. There is an urgent need for China to invest in a reliable road traffic injury surveillance system that can provide information for describing key risk factors, evaluating the impact of safety policies, and benchmarking achievements. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd."

Objective To evaluate factors associated with selfreported risk-taking behaviour in recreational skiers and snowboarders. Methods Speeds of skiers and snowboarders were measured with a radar speed gun and sex, age, nationality, height, weight and helmet use, used type of gear, self-estimated skill level and self-estimated fi tness level were recorded. In addition, participants were asked if they considered themselves as cautious or risk-taking skier or snowboarder. Results In total, 453 skiers (39.6 (14.8) years) and 74 snowboarders (26.4 (9.6) years) have been interviewed. A stepwise forward logistic regression model revealed fi ve independent factors for a risk-taking behaviour on slopes. Adjusted OR and their 95% CI showed that risk takers were <40 years (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.51 to 3.80), had a higher skill level (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.25 to 3.50), were more likely males (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.22 to 3.26), had a lower body mass index (22.8 vs 24.2) and skied with higher speeds (on average 53 vs 45 km/h) compared to cautious skiers. Conclusion Risk-taking behaviour on ski slopes is associated with younger age, higher skiing ability, male sex, lower body mass index and on average higher speeds. Helmet use is not associated with riskier behaviour on slopes. In addition, helmet use has to be recommended because helmet use reduces the risk of head injuries among skiers and snowboarders."

The system, consisting of three mobile units, was implemented along 14 corridors. Two separate analyses were conducted on data collected from January 2000 to December 2005. Findings from a previous study done for the North Carolina Governor's Highway Safety Program were updated. The first, and primary, analysis was a before-and-after analysis of collisions. This study used Hauer's comparison group methodology. Three different collision data sets were analyzed: total collisions, data accounting for regression to the mean, and data for five heavily enforced corridors. On the basis of the analysis, the impact of regression to the mean appears to be negligible. The results indicate that the camera program likely reduced collisions in corridors with automated enforcement. The second analysis observed whether compliance with posted speed limits was enhanced. Mean speeds, median speeds, 85th percentile speeds, and percentages of drivers more than 10 mph over the speed limit were analyzed. The analyses found speed reductions caused by the camera program. On the basis of these findings, it was recommend that the City of Charlotte continue the automated speed enforcement program. Other agencies considering speed camera programs can benefit from the knowledge gained in Charlotte."

The varied processing parameters were the geometric and the kinematics parameters, mainly, such as: the relative speed gun-substrate, the spray distance, the spray angle, the relative positioning powder injector-spray gun trajectory, the number of passes and the powder feed rate. The variations of the geometry and some of the structural parameters were analyzed relatively to the aforementioned varied parameters. Thus, a large set of spray pattern parameters was designed. This set considers mostly the spray pattern geometry. All the relationships between the processing parameters and the spray pattern parameters were hence grouped in a spray deposition model. The second step of this work consisted in optimizing the robotic (i.e., spray gun) trajectory using a robotic code, which permits a realistic simulation of the spray gun speed and its inertia. Using this simulation software, a trajectory file was built. In the third step of the work, an expert system was developed by combining the spray deposition model with the trajectory.

The coverage of the road network then allows increased surveillance of users. The deployment of this system constitutes a 'Technical revolution' in the manner of operating the checks. The results are convincing; a reduction in traffic speeds and an improvement in the road casualty toll. The system is also based on an original concept: local partnerships coordinated by a national office that must self-finance their operations. The speed camera programme is thus also an example of the implementation of a policy influenced by New Public Management. In fact, there are obvious parallels between the operation of the new automatic speed equipment and that of the traffic police tasks provided by police forces. In summary, the technical revolution will be combined with administrative continuity. Points for practitioners: The introduction of automatic speed checks in Great Britain is a practical example of the implementation of automatic equipment replacing roles previously provided by other organizations, which will attract the interest of practitioners working on institutional change. It also allows us to discern the consequences of the introduction of a tool arising from new technologies, to understand its implementation into existing administrative practices and the change in relations with users. Finally, the operating methods for the equipment organization, divided between a centre responsible for strategy and local partnerships responsible for operational implementation within a financial framework requiring self-financing, are an original example of taking over an activity traditionally devolved to police organizations. © 2007 2007 IIAS, SAGE Publications."

Therefore, conventional traffic enforcement should be supplemented with advanced technologies, such as intersection safety cameras. Intersection safety cameras, often referred to as red light cameras (RLCs), are being used increasingly to help communities enforce against deliberate red light running. Since the 1970s, Europe, Australia, and North America have been using photo enforcement technology to improve safety at intersections. The City of Edmonton, Canada, has used automated photo enforcement as part of the overall traffic enforcement activity. The Intersection Safety Camera Program started as a pilot project in 1998, which quickly expanded into a comprehensive program for the entire city. Because a significant period had elapsed since the inception of the program, the Edmonton Police Commission wanted a study to determine the overall safety effect of the photo enforcement program. This paper describes the evaluation of Edmonton's Intersection Safety Camera (ISC) program. The paper describes the methodology used in the evaluation, the data collection- compilation effort required for the evaluation, and, finally, the results of the program measured in relation to reducing the number of collisions at the intersections that were treated with photo enforcement cameras. Also included is a summary of the literature associated with the deployment of RLCs."

Several semi- and fully automated techniques for determining the number of persons in a moving vehicle, including operator-monitored video cameras and infrared composite imaging, have undergone limited field testing. The technical merits of invehicle and roadside systems for automated vehicle occupancy verification systems have been examined extensively. This paper complements those efforts by providing the policy and legal implications of automated systems for occupancy enforcement. The primary form of automated enforcement technology currently used in the United States is photographic imagery recorded by automated violation detection systems. For moving violations, these systems almost exclusively take the form of red light and speed enforcement, unlike toll evasion, which is typically punishable as an infraction. Principal objections to automated enforcement for occupancy purposes have involved privacy and due process concerns. Under an automated occupancy enforcement tool, the occupancy enforcement regime would likely face the same legal and privacy challenges as automated enforcement cameras and similar devices. This paper examines the current legislation related to automated enforcement practices, as well as an illustration of the arguments against their use. These arguments raise questions about the legality of automated enforcement systems and the perceived invasion of privacy some drivers may associate with such systems. The three primary privacy issues associated with an automated system for occupancy enforcement concern the photographic record of occupants, vehicle infrastructure integration barriers, and the legal definition of a high-occupancy vehicle infraction."

The methodology is based on the relationship between speed and capacity in work zones. Speed is adjusted to accouot for the adverse effects of roadway geometries, work intensity, speed enforcement, and other work zone factors. Speed reductions for work intensity and narrow lane widths were determined previously by use of data from work zones. Values from the Highway Capacity Manual were used where data from work zones were not available. The fundamental difference between this methodology and previous approaches is that it accounts for the various work zone factors. Two applications of the methodology are presented, one with queuing and one without queuing, to real-world work zones. Results are compared with held data. For the nonqueuing site, the computed speed and capacity were 44.4 mph and 1,778 vehicles per hour per lane (vphpl), respectively, while the field speed and capacity were 44 mph and 1,708 vphpl, respectively. For the queuing site, computed capacity was 1,012 vphpl while the field capacity was 1,220 vphpl. Considering the assumptions made in the methodology for some of the parameters, these results build confidence in the methodology. Extensive validation of this methodology is strongly recommended."

In order to reduce speed-related crashes, the city of Scottsdale, Arizona implemented the first fixed-camera photo speed enforcement program (SEP) on a limited access freeway in the US. The 9-month demonstration program spanning from January 2006 to October 2006 was implemented on a 6.5 mile urban freeway segment of Arizona State Route 101 running through Scottsdale. This paper presents the results of a comprehensive analysis of the impact of the SEP on speeding behavior, crashes, and the economic impact of crashes. The impact on speeding behavior was estimated using generalized least square estimation, in which the observed speeds and the speeding frequencies during the program period were compared to those during other periods. The impact of the SEP on crashes was estimated using 3 evaluation methods: a before-and-after (BA) analysis using a comparison group, a BA analysis with traffic flow correction, and an empirical Bayes BA analysis with time-variant safety. The analysis results reveal that speeding detection frequencies (speeds ≥ 76 mph) increased by a factor of 10.5 after the SEP was (temporarily) terminated. Average speeds in the enforcement zone were reduced by about 9 mph when the SEP was implemented, after accounting for the influence of traffic flow. All crash types were reduced except rear-end crashes, although the estimated magnitude of impact varies across estimation methods (and their corresponding assumptions). When considering Arizona-specific crash related injury costs, the SEP is estimated to yield about $17 million in annual safety benefits. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd."

Unsafe speed is one of the major traffic safety challenges facing motorized nations. In 2003, unsafe speed contributed to 31 percent of all fatal collisions, causing a loss of 13,380 lives in the United States alone. The economic impact of speeding is tremendous. According to NHTSA, the cost of unsafe speed related collisions to the American society exceeds $40 billion per year. In response, automated photo radar speed enforcement programs have been implemented in many countries. This study assesses the economic impacts of a large-scale photo radar program in British Columbia. The knowledge generated from this study could inform policy makers and project managers in making informed decisions with regard to this highly effective and efficient, yet very controversial program. Methods. This study establishes speed and safety effects of photo radar programs by summarizing two physical impact investigations in British Columbia. It then conducts a cost-benefit analysis to assess the program's economic impacts. The cost-benefit analysis takes into account both societal and funding agency's perspectives. It includes a comprehensive account of major impacts. It uses willingness to pay principle to value human lives saved and injuries avoided. It incorporates an extended sensitivity analysis to quantify the robustness of base case conclusions. Results. The study reveals an annual net benefit of approximately C$114 million in year 2001 Canadian dollars to British Columbians. The study also finds a net annual saving of over C$38 million for the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia (ICBC) that funded the program. These results are robust under almost all alternative scenarios tested. The only circumstance under which the net benefit of the program turns negative is when the real safety effects were one standard deviation below the estimated values, which is possible but highly unlikely. Conclusion. Automated photo radar traffic safety enforcement can be an effective and efficient means to manage traffic speed, reduce collisions and injuries, and combat the huge resulting economic burden to society. The cost-effectiveness of the program takes on special meaning and urgency when considering the present and future government funding constraints. The application of the program, however, should be planned and implemented with caution. Every effort should be made to focus on and to promote the program on safety improvement grounds. The program can be easily terminated because of political considerations, if the public perceives it as a cash cow to enhance government revenue. Copyright © 2005 Taylor & Francis Inc."

In order to substantially lower the fatality rate on South African roads, stringent speed enforcement should be implemented and measures adopted to bring amenities closer to informal settlements prone to jaywalking; coupled with education, enforcement and engineering. Fine-tuning the annual reduction of road fatalities involves enforcement to reduce vehicles prone to tyre bursts and engineering techniques to minimise road sections that are wet, slippery or have sharp bends."

Recent headlines claim that they save around 100 lives a year in the UK while opponents still argue that they are a distraction to drivers and as a consequence may actually increase the road death toll. This paper presents a detailed evaluation of the impact of 62 fixed cameras on 30mph roads in the UK. The changes in accident frequency attributable to the effect of cameras on both speed and route choice are separately estimated, as are the changes due to general trends in accidents and regression-to-mean: changes that would have occurred with or without a camera. It was found that the average effect of the cameras was a fall in personal injury accidents of some 25%, of which a fall of some 20% was attributable to their impact on speed with a 5% fall due to diversion of traffic away from routes with cameras. Safety improvements were observed over a distance of up to 1km upstream and downstream of the cameras, with no evidence that any sudden changes in speed on approaching or passing the cameras had any detrimental effect on safety. The impact of the cameras on fatal and serious accidents was rather less certain and served to highlight the dangers of ignoring regression-to-mean effects. while reductions of the order of one third were observed, more than half of this was attributable to regression-to-mean. It is argued that the current guidelines for locating cameras, and the criteria for judging their success or failure, place too much emphasis on observed numbers of fatal and serious accidents without proper controls for regression-to-mean some roads which might benefit from increased speed enforcement may not qualify for a camera while cameras which are actually improving road safety may be judged unsuccessful."

This technology observes and records driver and pedestrian behavior, as driver behavior is at the root of the crossing safety problem. Judicial concerns and public perception and support levels are also issues of concern. Photo enforcement is an option to assist law enforcement to increase safety at public crossings. While some privacy issues remain, this system can be a reliable, cost-effective way to discourage unsafe driver behavior. Today, 75 countries use traffic cameras. Internationally, photo enforcement has been in use for more than 20 years. Experience has shown that visible, high-profile law-enforcement programs like photo enforcement reduce the number of highway-rail crossing violations. Photo enforcement at six highway-rail crossings across the United States showed positive results in reducing violations. The results of investigations at the six sites indicated a reduction of violations in the range of 34% to 92%.

Photo radar has become a controversial subject among the driving public, largely due to its tendency to produce substantially increased revenues for the implementing governments. From the road safety literature, there appears to be a causal link between driving at excessive speeds and traffic accidents (and fatalities). Photo radar is designed to reduce speeding by increasing the likelihood of catching those drivers over some pre-determined speed threshold, but can be limited in certain circumstances by the inability to identify the driver. A simplified driver-choice model is provided to demonstrate the effects of photo radar on speeding when the driver can be identified (and demerit points applied) and when the vehicle owner is applied a monetary fine alone. Raw data from Victoria, Australia, suggest that photo radar has significantly reduced both fatalities and collisions after its introduction in 1990, and controlling for other factors, including proxies for weather conditions and drunken driving, we find that photo radar can indeed be an effective road safety device."

Worldwide, road traffic injuries are the leading cause of death by injury and the ninth leading cause of all deaths. Photo Radar speed enforcement has been implemented in the United States and many other industrialized countries, yet its cost-effectiveness from a societal viewpoint, taking all significant impacts into account, has not been reported. This paper fills this gap, reporting on a Photo Radar traffic safety program introduced in 1996 in British Columbia, Canada, and incorporating the results of rigorous statistical analyses on speed and crash impacts into a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis from both societal and sponsoring-agency perspectives. The study reveals that the Rhoto Radar Program cost C$27 million per year in 2001 Canadian dollars (≈US$21 million) and generated benefits valued at $142 million per year (≈US$109 million), for net societal benefits of C$115 million per year (≈US$88 million). It was estimated that the sponsoring agency saved C$38 million (≈SUS$29 million) annually in claim costs. These results are robust to plausible alternate assumptions. Societal net benefits become negative only if the reduction in injuries and fatalities is one standard error below the expected value, or if private travel time is valued at or above C$15 per hour. Agency claim cost savings are greater than program costs under all scenarios tested. These results are likely applicable to jurisdictions in developed countries with similar traffic infrastructure: Greater use of highway photo radar speed enforcement would be good public policy. © 2006 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management."

The identification of effective strategies for the prevention of road traffic injuries is of global public health importance. Measures aimed at reducing traffic speed are considered essential to preventing road injuries; the use of speed enforcement detection devices (including speed cameras and radar and laser devices) is one such measure. OBJECTIVES: To assess whether the use of speed enforcement detection devices (SEDs) reduces the incidence of speeding, road traffic crashes, injuries and deaths. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science (and Social Science) Citation Index, TRANSPORT, PsycINFO, CINAHL, EconLit. We searched the websites of road safety and motoring associations, as well as general internet searches. We handsearched selected journals and conference proceedings, and contacted experts in the field. The searches were conducted during May to November 2004. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials and controlled before-after studies that assessed the impact of speed enforcement detection devices on speeding, road crashes, injuries and deaths were eligible for inclusion. For studies involving co-interventions, SEDs had to be the major intervention focus of the study to be eligible. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We independently screened search results, assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed methodological quality. Due to variability between and within included studies, a pooled analysis was not appropriate. MAIN RESULTS: No randomised controlled trials were identified. Twenty-six studies met the inclusion criteria, of which 22 were controlled before-after trials incorporating a distinct control or comparison group(s) and four were interrupted time series designs with a comparison group(s). Fourteen studies reported speed and crash outcomes, seven reported crash outcomes only and five reported speed outcomes only. All but one study reported an absolute reduction in pre/post average speeds. A pre/post reduction in the proportion of speeding vehicles ranged across studies from 5% to 70% depending on the speed threshold set. Pre/post reductions of 50% to 65% were reported in the proportion of speeding vehicles travelling >15 km/h over the speed limit. Compared with controls, the relative improvement was from 1% to 15% for average speed and from 14% to 65% for percent speeding.All studies reporting crash outcomes reported an absolute pre/post reduction in all crashes and injury related crashes. In the vicinity of camera sites these pre/post reductions ranged from 14% to 72% for all crashes, 8% to 46% for injury crashes, and 40% to 45% for crashes resulting in fatalities or serious injuries. More generalised effects over wider areas showed an absolute pre/post crash reduction ranging from 9% to 35%, 7% to 30% for all injury crashes and 13% to 58% for crashes resulting in fatalities alone, or in combination with serious injuries. The studies of longer duration showed that these positive trends were either maintained or improved with time. Compared with controls, the relative improvement in pre/post crash numbers resulting in any type of injury ranged from 5% to 36%. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Despite the methodological limitations of the studies reviewed, the consistency of reported positive reductions in speed and crash outcomes across all studies suggest that SEDs are a promising intervention for reducing the number of road traffic injuries and deaths. More studies of a scientifically rigorous nature are necessary to provide a stronger evidence base that these interventions are worthwhile. There is a need for international harmonisation of data collection methods, including standards on how best to measure speeds and collect crash data, over lengthy intervention and follow-up periods, as well as some consensus as to the expression of outcomes in studies, so that studies can be compared."

It was found that, the impact of schemes with vertical deflections is independent of the change in mean speed: an accident reduction of 44% is predicted by the model irrespective of the impact on speed. For cameras and other types of engineering schemes, a simple relationship between the change in mean speed and the consequent change in accidents is available. For the range of mean speeds typically found on 30 mph roads, the percentage accident reduction per 1mph speed reduction is around 4% for cameras and 7-8% for schemes with horizontal features. While larger percentage accident reductions are achieved per 1 mph speed reduction on lower speed roads, larger speed reductions and larger overall percentage accident reductions are obtained on roads with higher before mean speeds. It is possible to predict both changes in speeds and accidents before treatment using the models derived from this study and these models confirm that schemes with vertical deflections are most effective in reducing both speeds and accidents. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Speed limit violation was considered a dichotomous variable with two categories, violation and compliance. Binary logistic regression was also used to examine the risk of speeding as a function of covariates and interaction terms. The results of analysis revealed that the major contributing factors for approaching speed were site, rush-hour-status, traffic light condition, vehicle type and driver gender. In particular, light status was the highest contributor to speed. In addition, the results of logistic regression showed significant sites and rush-hour effects on speeding, with the risk of limit violation in the suburbs nearly six-fold that in urban areas. The relative risk of speeding for travelling in non-rush hours is three times higher than that for rush-hour.

This paper summarizes the results of a deployment of the rational speed limits (RSLs) approach on two limited access highways in Virginia. The RSL approach involves a coordinated campaign to post sound and credible speed limits, increase speed enforcement, and implement public information and education (PI&E). The goal of the RSL approach is to better regulate travel speeds, thereby improving the safety of the traveling public. While it is common to use enforcement and PI&E in attempt to improve speed limit compliance, there is not much information on whether improvements generated by these campaigns can be sustained following the end of the formal campaign. This paper presents the results of a four-year project that examined speeds, driver attitudes, and safety before, during, and after the RSL approach was implemented. Two limited access highways where speed limits were increased from 55 to 65 mph were examined. Public perception survey results showed that the new 65 mph speed limits were well supported with over 80% agreeing with the new speed limits. The speed analysis showed that the average speed increased by a statistically significant margin immediately after the speed limit was increased, but compliance with the new posted speed limit was also significantly higher than what was observed with the old, 55 mph limit. There were practically no significant changes in speed during the increased enforcement and PI&E campaign or when speeds were examined one year after the end of the campaign. In addition, the standard deviation of speeds was fairly consistent throughout the before and after periods, which suggests that crash likelihood was not increased due to the increased posted speed limit. In fact, crash data showed that safety at the two demonstration sites was actually better than anticipated based on trends at similar comparison sites where speed limits were increased but no additional enforcement or PI&E were present. The results of the study imply that compliance and safety improvements can be sustained for at least a year after a coordinated enforcement and education campaign is completed, provided that speed limits are set appropriately. © 2009 ASCE."

Enforcement was predominantly carried out by means of mobile radar and focused on rural non-motorway roads. Information and publicity supported the enforcement activities. The evaluation covered a period of 5 years of enforcement. The speed data of these 5 years and the year preceding the enforcement project showed a significant decrease in mean speed and the percentage speed limit violators over time. The largest decrease was found in the first year of the enforcement project and in the fourth year of the project, when the enforcement effort was further intensified. There were similar decreases in speeding at both the enforced roads and at the nearby comparison roads that were not subjected to the targeted speed enforcement project, which may be explained by spillover effects. The best estimate for the safety effect of the enforcement project is a reduction of 21% in both the number of injury accidents and the number of serious casualties.

Laboratory simulation techniques can achieve an overall uncertainty of measurement of better than 1 km/h and in some cases as low as 0.3 km/h. Advances in field testing techniques also allow characterising an installed systems performance. These testing techniques provide a detailed comprehensive picture of the operation, reliability, and accuracy of road safety enforcement technology and provide a valuable tool in increasing public confidence and credibility in automated speed enforcement programs. Improved confidence and credibility aids in the effectiveness of the program leading to changes in driver behaviour and reaching the ultimate goal of improving safety on our roads."

Aggressive driving behaviors such as speeding are primary factors contributing to major-injury and fatality crashes in rural areas. Studies have also shown higher crash rates at specific highway locations such as rural work zones that temporarily set lower speed limits. To address the challenges of rural safety, the U.S. Department of Transportation kicked-off the Rural Safety Initiative in February 2008. One technological solution that has been developed to help improve the safety of rural travel through a reduction in aggressive driving is Automated Enforcement Systems (ASE). Despite the documented effectiveness, there may be legal impediments for some jurisdictions to implement ASE. To help address some of these legal impediments the California Department of Transportation in partnership with the Western Transportation Institute - Montana State University was selected by U. S. Department of Transportation to receive RSIP funds to implement, demonstrate, and validate the Augmented Speed Enforcement System (aSE). Augmented Speed Enforcement (aSE) differs from traditional ASE in that it uses the information about detected violators in real-time to notify a linked CHP officer to manually track and stop the speeder to process the citation."

Almost one quarter of speeding-related fatalities occur on streets with speed limits of 35 mph or less. In 2007, Montgomery County, Maryland, implemented the state's first automated speed enforcement program, with camera use limited to residential streets with speeds limits of 35 mph or less and school zones. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate initial effects of camera enforcement on traffic speeds and to assess public attitudes. Methods. Vehicle speeds were measured approximately 6 months before and 6 months after speed cameras were deployed and warning signs were installed. Speed data were collected on a sample of roads with and without camera enforcement in Montgomery County, as well as on a sample of roads in a comparison community that did not have speed cameras. In addition, telephone surveys were conducted in Montgomery County. Results. Relative to speeds of drivers on roads in the comparison community, the proportion of drivers in Montgomery County traveling more than 10 mph above posted speed limits declined by about 70% at locations with both warning signs and speed camera enforcement, 39% at locations with warning signs but no speed cameras, and 16% on residential streets with neither warning signs nor speed cameras. Public opinion surveys found 74% of Montgomery County drivers thought speeding on residential streets was a problem. Six months after enforcement began, 60% of drivers were aware of the camera program and 62% supported it. Conclusions. The camera program was effective at reducing speeding on targeted streets. The finding of speed reductions beyond targeted locations is evidence that highly visible automated enforcement can promote community-wide changes in driver behavior. Although a majority of drivers supported automated speed enforcement, about one third opposed it. Jurisdictions planning to implement speed cameras should draw on international experience to anticipate controversies that generally arise and take steps to address them."

The company exhibited the development through the Home Office Type Approval (HOTA) to operate over distances between a minimum of 100m and a maximum of 300km. The camera head at the site is linked by optical cable to an adjacent remote imaging detector (RID), storing associated color images and dual satellite-derived time stamps. The adaptation of RedFusion to meet TfL's need for three different speed zones can be controlled within the monitored stretch. RedSpeed has also committed to ISA as a new direction including noise reduction, carbon emissions and fuel consumption as well as enhanced journey-time reliability."

The extent to which the public regard speeding as a problem that requires enforcement is less clear. Analysis was conducted on public perceptions of antisocial behaviors including speeding traffic. The data was collected as part of the British Crime Survey, a face-to-face interview with UK residents on issues relating to crime. The antisocial behavior section required participants to state the degree to which they perceived 16 antisocial behaviors to be a problem in their area. Results revealed that speeding traffic was perceived as the greatest problem in local communities, regardless of whether respondents were male or female, young, middle aged, or old. The rating of speeding traffic as the greatest problem in the community was replicated in a second, smaller postal survey, where respondents also provided strong support for enforcement on residential roads, and indicated that traveling immediately above the speed limit on residential roads was unacceptable. Results are discussed in relation to practical implications for speed enforcement, and the prioritization of limited police resources. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

The effectiveness of speed photo enforcement (SPE) (by radar) in reducing speeds and increasing speed limit compliance in work zones was evaluated for the first time in the United States, at Illinois work zones. Details are presented on SPE implementation and its effectiveness at the point it was stationed and at a downstream location in a work zone. Speed data were collected at the location of SPE and at a location 1,5 mi downstream in the work zone to determine the point and spatial effects of SPE. Speeds were measured for free-flowing and platooned cars and heavy vehicles in shoulder and median lanes. Results showed that SPE is effective in reducing the average speed and increasing compliance with work zone speed limit. The SPE reduced speed in the median lane more than in the shoulder lane, as expected. In addition, the speed of free-flowing vehicles was reduced more than for platooned vehicles. The reduction of the mean speed varied from 3.2 to 7,3 mph. The percentage of vehicles exceeding the speed limit near SPE was reduced from about 40% to 8% for free-flowing cars and from 17% to 4% for free-flowing heavy vehicles. Near the SPE van, none of the cars exceeded the speed limit by more than 10 mph, and none of the heavy vehicles exceeded it by more than 5 mph. The data also showed a mixed spatial effect for SPE. At the downstream location, the speed reduction for cars was not significant, while it varied from 0.9 to 2.5 mph for heavy vehicles."

In Germany, as in the UK, attempts are being made to change drivers' behaviour by both enforcement and persuasion. One method of persuasion being tried is the use of 'secret' signs to warn of excessive speed. These signs are normally blank but display a warning when triggered by a speeding vehicle. The historic use of secret signs and trials of systems is presented along with a review of their use in other countries. The systems reviewed range from those which check vehicle speed to ones which check not only the speed of the vehicle but also its weight and dimensions, so that warnings specific to that vehicle can be given. A UK trial using number-plate recognition is also reviewed. Before-and-after studies have shown that in the right location these signs achieve up to 87.6% improvement in compliance with speed limits. Not all signs proved to be successful, however. The signs have been found to be most successful during their early life. As drivers become used to the signs, the effectiveness reduces. A system used in the Netherlands uses a variety of messages to overcome this problem. Vandalism has also been reported as a problem with these signs, with one in the US being destroyed by high-velocity bullets. Studies in the UK have shown that these signs can be more effective in reducing vehicle speeds than direct police enforcement using speed 'guns'."

Al Ain is the fourth largest city in the United Arab Emirates, located about 120 Km from Dubai. Methods: The spot speed data of randomly selected vehicles using speed guns was collected from three major arterial urban roads. The data was collected three months before and three months after the implementation of the demerit points system. The free flow conditions were considered during the data collection. The data was analyzed using SPSS program. Results and Conclusions: The results revealed that the demerit points system has statistically no significant impact on the speeding behavior of drivers in Al Ain. One of the plausible reasons for insignificance affect of the demerit point system could be the lack of effective traffic monitoring system. This study recommends that to influence the drivers' behavior an effective traffic monitoring system should be provided to achieve the desired outcomes of introducing tougher laws such as demerit point system. The study also recommends to collect more data to investigate the changes in the speeding behavior of drivers. © The Author(s) 2010."

Variable speed control systems have been implemented in a number of jurisdictions throughout the world. Many of these systems have been deployed to address specific safety issues, such as steep grades or frequent occurrences of adverse weather such as fog, high winds, or blowing snow. A smaller number of systems have been deployed as a more general traffic management tool and even for these systems, there is currently limited documentation describing the quantitative safety and operational impacts. Furthermore, the impacts that are reported are primarily from systems in Europe, and may not be directly transferable to North America. This paper describes a methodology developed to evaluate the safety impacts of variable speed control systems and presents the results obtained using this methodology to evaluate a candidate variable speed control system for an urban freeway in Toronto, Canada. The evaluation was conducted using a microscopic simulation model combined with a categorical crash potential model for estimating safety impacts. The keys findings from the study show that the candidate variable speed control has the potential to provide relatively large safety benefits (i.e. up to a 40% reduction in potential for crashes). Furthermore, unlike speed management techniques that rely on in-vehicle devices, variable speed control systems can be implemented with existing technologies and with the existing vehicle fleet. The study also found, however, that the safety impacts vary depending on traffic conditions; the variable speed control system logic, and the parameters within the system algorithms. Furthermore, the results are based on several important assumptions about drivers' reaction to variable speed limits. In particular, the analysis assumed a high degree of compliance - A level likely to be achieved only through the use of automated speed enforcement. The degree to which this and other assumptions are valid, and the impact that violation of these assumptions may have on the level of safety improvements, requires additional investigation."

The study also evaluated differences in speed between males and females and the ability of subjects to estimate their speed. The authors measured the speed of some 650 individuals at three different ski resorts in the U.S. during the winter of 2002/2003. One resort was primarily a destination resort in Utah, one was a day area in New York, and the third resort in Vermont had a combination of destination and day skiers. The speeds were determined by means of a calibrated radar speed gun. Speeds were gathered on consecutive skiers and snowboarders as they were observed from an uphill, looking downhill position. The speed recorded was the highest speed observed during a several second interval while the observed person went through several turns as the skiers and snowboarders moved away from the observer. All observations were made on wide, straight, well-groomed 'blue square' (more difficult) trails. The slopes ranged from 16-20° in steepness. The average speed for all observations was 43.0 km/h (26.7 mph), with a standard deviation of 11.2 km/h (7.0 mph). The average speed for skiers of 44.5 km/h (27.6 mph) was significantly higher than that for snowboarders at 38.9 km/h (24.1 mph). The average speed under good visibility of 46.7 km/h (29.0 mph) was significantly higher than for poor visibility conditions at 38.3 km/h (23.7 mph). The average speed for helmet users of 45.8 km/h (28.4 mph) was significantly higher than those not using a helmet at 41.0 km/h (25.4 mph). Males ski and snowboard significantly faster than females. Skiers and snowboarders are fair at estimating their speed (r = 0.56), but they tend to underestimate their speeds the faster they go; for example, at an actual 48 km/ h (30 mph), they estimate that they are traveling at 37 km/h (23 mph). The observed speeds are well above the speeds (22.6 km/h, or 14.0 mph) used for ASTM F 2040 helmet testing protocols for recreational snow sports helmets. Copyright © 2005 by ASTM International."

Methods Time series analyses were performed separately for the arterial roads and the beltway. The stretches of arterial roads encompassing 500 m before and after the location of a speed camera were considered the enforced stretches, the remaining stretches of arterial roads being considered the comparison group. The outcome measures were the numbers of crashes and of people injured. Quasi-Poisson regression models were fitted, controlling for time trend, seasonality and implementation of other road safety measures. Results Both on the enforced and non-enforced arterial road stretches, the risks of crashes and people injured were similar in the two periods. On the beltway, reductions of 30% (95% CI 38% to 20%) and 26% (95% CI 36% to 14%) were observed, respectively. Conclusions Speed cameras do not reduce the numbers of crashes or people injured on the arterial roads of Barcelona. However, they are effective in the short and in the long-term on the beltway. Speed enforcement through fixed speed cameras is thus effective in mediumehigh-speed roads, although effectiveness could not be generalised to roads with lower speed limits and traffic lights."

About 10% of the drivers supposed that traditional police enforcement has zero tolerance. 15-20% of the drivers supposed that automatic camera enforcement has zero tolerance. Most drivers, about 80%, estimated the tolerance to be 10 kmph at most. For rural speeds about 15% of the drivers thought that the enforcement tolerance was higher than 10 kmph. About 60-70% of the drivers thought that police should enforce speeding by less than 15 kmph with a fine.

Almost all drivers had driven on a road with automatic camera enforcement. 86% of the drivers thought that automatic camera enforcement was acceptable while 11% thought it was inappropriate. The ones driving frequently on roads with automatic camera enforcement supposed that the enforcement tolerance was higher than the ones driving less frequently on them.

Samples were obtained in the prone position under local anesthesia with a 14-gauge needle and an automated high-speed gun. An average of 4.3 cores per lesion were acquired. In 68 patients (64%) an additional surgical biopsy was performed, 38 (36%) had clinical and mammographic follow-up. Results: In 4 of the 106 stereotactic biopsies insufficient material for the histological examination was obtained. In the 68 core biopsies with surgical correlation there were no false-positive, but 2 false-negative results with regard to the malignancy of the lesion (sensitivity: 93.8%; specificity: 100%).

Since then, the deployment of this technology has gradually spread, with the SPECS cameras becoming an increasingly common sight around the UK's road network. Although originally conceived and designed as a safety control system for permanent routes with a significant collision history, these cameras are now frequently deployed in major roadworks projects. In these applications, it is not just the safety considerations that determine the choice of enforcement technology but the additional benefits of harmonised vehicle speeds, resulting in smoother traffic flows and more reliable journeys. This paper explores why it is possible for an enforcement technology to have such a major impact on traffic flows, when it is not the physical roadside equipment that controls a vehicle's speed - rather the psychological impact on the driver, which results in a modified behaviour."

The study was made by measuring the speeds of cars and vans outside queues with a hidden speed radar. After the speed measurement the vehicles were pulled over and the drivers answered a questionnaire about speeding. Over 60 % of the drivers answering the questionnaire supposed that police enforce speeding on the routes mostly used by the drivers at least once a month. A third thought that speeding was enforced a couple of times annually at most. About 10 % of the drivers supposed that traditional police enforcement has zero tolerance. 15-20 % of the drivers supposed that automatic camera enforcement has zero tolerance. Most drivers, about 80 %, estimated the tolerance to be 10 kmph at most. For rural speeds about 15 % of the drivers thought that the enforcement tolerance was higher than 10 kmph. About 60-70 % of the drivers thought that police should enforce speeding by less than 15 kmph with a fine. About 80-90 % of the drivers thought that police should enforce speeding by even less than 10 kmph with at least a reminder. Almost all drivers had driven on a road with automatic camera enforcement. 86 % of the drivers thought that automatic camera enforcement was acceptable while 11% thought it was inappropriate. The ones driving frequently on roads with automatic camera enforcement supposed that the enforcement tolerance was higher than the ones driving less frequently on them. Examination of the actual speeds of the interviewed drivers showed that the lower the speeds were the lower the supposed enforcement tolerance was.

Speed photo enforcement with speed feedback system is a promising technology for speed management in work zones. A component of the photo enforcement system is the speed feedback display device that has some effects in reducing the speeds of motorists in work zones. Data were collected on an interstate highway work zone in three phases and statistical analysis was performed to determine the temporal effect of the speed feedback device. It was found that feedback device was effective in reducing average speed by 4.4 mph in a few days after the deployment. After three weeks of operating the feedback system, the average speed was further reduced by 2.3 mph. Both these reductions were statistically significant. Thus, at this location, providing speed feedback reduced the speeds of the motorists not only immediately after the system was deployed, but also three weeks after deployment. Copyright ASCE 2006."

Both dimensions-crash frequency and crash severity-are needed to obtain a full accounting of road safety. Extensive literature and common sense both dictate that crashes are not created equal, with fatalities costing society more than 1,000 times the cost of property damage crashes on average. Despite this glaring disparity, the profession has not unanimously embraced or successfully defended a nonarbitrary severity weighting approach for analyzing safety data and conducting safety analyses. It is argued here that the two dimensions (frequency and severity) are made available by intelligently and reliably weighting crash frequencies and converting all crashes to property-damage-only crash equivalents (PDOEs) by using comprehensive societal unit crash costs. This approach is analogous to calculating axle load equivalents in the prediction of pavement damage: for instance, a 40,000-lb truck causes 4,025 times more stress than does a 4,000-lb car and so simply counting axles is not sufficient. Calculating PDOEs using unit crash costs is the most defensible and nonarbitrary weighting scheme, allows for the simple incorporation of severity and frequency, and leads to crash models that are sensitive to factors that affect crash severity. Moreover, using PDOEs diminishes the errors introduced by underreporting of less severe crashes-an added benefit of the PDOE analysis approach. The method is illustrated with rural road segment data from South Korea (which in practice would develop PDOEs with Korean crash cost data)."

The risk of receiving a ticket for speeding is also considered. A trip disutility concept is selected to combine the three components of speed choice (safety, time, and enforcement). The perceived crash risk and speed enforcement are considered as speed deterrents while the perceived value of a time gain is considered as a speed enticement. According to this concept, speeds that minimize the perceived trip disutility are preferred by drivers. The modeled trade-off behavior does not have to be fully rational since it is affected by drivers' preferences and their ability to perceive the risk. As such, the proposed framework follows the concept of bound rationality. The attractiveness of the model lies in its parameters being estimable with the observed preferred speeds and then interpretable as the factors of risk perception, the subjective value of time, and the perceived risk of speed enforcement. The proposed method may successfully supplement behavioral studies based on a driver survey. The study focuses on four-lane rural and suburban roads in Indiana, USA. The behavior of two types of drivers (trucks and cars) is modeled. The selection of test sites was such that the roads and other local characteristics varied across the studied sites while the population of drivers could be assumed as the same. The density of intersections, land development along the road, and the presence of sidewalks were the identified prominent risk perception factors. Another interesting finding is that the speed limit seems to encourage slow drivers to drive faster and fast drivers to drive slower. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Variables that affect the gun-spraying patterns are number of guns, conveyer speed, gun spacing, part height, spray width, part shape, nozzle shape, part design, gun motion, and powder. Gun set-up formulas have been developed to determine the number of fixed guns required, gun distance from part, spacing between guns, number of moving guns required, gun mover stroke, and gun mover speed. Examples of differing spray patterns are illustrated in the accompanying diagrams. The effect of gun mover speed and pattern overlap is shown as well as the effect of multiple guns. Thickness on test parts is illustrated for application at 0, 12, 21, and 24 oscillator strokes/min. Higher oscillator speeds produced more-uniform application patterns. In contrast, systems using reciprocating machinery to move guns exhibit sharper patterns (at travel direction change) and possibly a greater degree of coverage mismatch compared with a smoother pattern developed by oscillators."

Worldwide, road traffic injuries are the leading cause of death by injury and the ninth leading cause of all deaths. Photo Radar speed enforcement has been implemented in the United States and many other industrialized countries, yet its cost-effectiveness from a societal viewpoint, taking all significant impacts into account, has not been reported. This paper fills this gap, reporting on a Photo Radar traffic safety program introduced in 1996 in British Columbia, Canada, and incorporating the results of rigorous statistical analyses on speed and crash impacts into a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis from both societal and sponsoring-agency perspectives. The study reveals that the Photo Radar Program cost C$27 million per year in 2001 Canadian dollars (~ US$21 million) and generated benefits valued at $142 million per year (~ US$109 million), for net societal benefits of C$115 million per year (~ US$88 million). It was estimated that the sponsoring agency saved C$38 million (~ US$29 million) annually in claim costs. These results are robust to plausible alternate assumptions. Societal net benefits become negative only if the reduction in injuries and fatalities is one standard error below the expected value, or if private travel time is valued at or above C$15 per hour. Agency claim cost savings are greater than program costs under all scenarios tested. These results are likely applicable to jurisdictions in developed countries with similar traffic infrastructure: Greater use of highway photo radar speed enforcement would be good public policy. © 2008 the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management."

Traditional methods of limiting speed have only been moderately effective. Using the latest intelligent transportation technology, speed enforcement can be enhanced through vehicle speed management programs, often referred to as Intelligent Speed Adaptation (ISA). An ISA system monitors the location and speed of the vehicle, compares it to a defined set speed, and takes corrective action such as advising the driver and/or governing the top speed of the vehicle. ISA is an active research field in Europe where it is currently being evaluated. In addition to safety improvements, ISA has the potential to mitigate congestion by smoothing traffic flow during congested conditions, which may also lead to lower fuel consumption and pollutant emissions. In this paper, the energy and emissions impacts of ISA are investigated in detail using both simulation tools and real-world experimentation. This research makes use of state-of-the-art transportation/emissions modeling tools. The simulation analysis is focused on examining different speed management strategies under varying freeway congestion conditions. A set of limited real-world experiments have also been performed using real-time traffic information provided to an ISA-equipped vehicle driving in traffic. Results are compared to another non-equipped-ISA vehicle acting as a control, representing the general traffic flow.

First, the magnitude of the problem for driver compliance is assessed by a comparison of the 85th percentile speed with the posted speed limit. The second aspect deals with selected speed limits at study sites, and models for estimating these percentiles are suggested. Examining the effect of automated speed enforcement with speed radar cameras and the presence of police cars was the third aspect. A sample of slightly more than 69,000 spot-speed observations was gathered from 41 sites (14 freeways, 22 arterials, and 5 residential streets) during 2003 in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, and in Buraidah, a small city about 300 km north of Riyadh. Analysis showed that the study sites were suffering from a tremendous speed problem. Although the problem could be blamed in part on inappropriate selection of speed limits, the speeding trends disclosed that drivers overall tend to exceed the posted limit by a great amount. The proportions of motorists with 85th percentile speeds over the speed limit are 10%, 88%, and 100% on freeways, arterials, and residential streets, respectively. A primary concern is the relatively high speeds observed on residential streets. Although the speed limit on such streets does not exceed 40 km/h, the observed 85th percentiles were all more than 55 km/h; this highlights the speeding issue on these neighborhood streets, where pedestrian activities are prevalent. The study found that both enforcement methods, namely, speed radar cameras and police car presence, appeared effective and led to a reduction of mean speed by at least 10 km/h."

The study also evaluated differences in speed between males and females and the ability of subjects to estimate their speed. The authors measured the speed of some 650 individuals at three different ski resorts in the U.S. during the winter of 2002/2003. One resort was primarily a destination resort in Utah, one was a day area in New York, and the third resort in Vermont had a combination of destination and day skiers. The speeds were determined by means of a calibrated radar speed gun. Speeds were gathered on consecutive skiers and snowboarders as they were observed from an uphill, looking downhill position. The speed recorded was the highest speed observed during a several second interval while the observed person went through several turns as the skiers and snowboarders moved away from the observer. All observations were made on wide, straight, well-groomed 'blue square' (more difficult) trails. The slopes ranged from 16-20° in steepness. The average speed for all observations was 43.0 km/h (26.7 mph), with a standard deviation of 11.2 km/h (7.0 mph). The average speed for skiers of 44.5 km/h (27.6 mph) was significantly higher than that for snowboarders at 38.9 km/h (24.1 mph). The average speed under good visibility of 46.7 km/h (29.0 mph) was significantly higher than for poor visibility conditions at 38.3 km/h (23.7 mph). The average speed for helmet users of 45.8 km/h (28.4 mph) was significantly higher than those not using a helmet at 41.0 km/h (25.4 mph). Males ski and snowboard significantly faster than females. Skiers and snowboarders are fair at estimating their speed (r = 0.56), but they tend to underestimate their speeds the faster they go; for example, at an actual 48 km/h (30 mph), they estimate that they are traveling at 37 km/h (23 mph). The observed speeds are well above the speeds (22.6 km/h, or 14.0 mph) used for ASTM F 2040 helmet testing protocols for recreational snow sports helmets. Copyright © 2005 by ASTM International."

Legal limits are present on the gross mass and the loads imposed by individual axles, and on the overall dimensions permitted for large, heavy vehicles using public roads. The roll-over of logging trucks is linked to the high centers of gravity of the logging trucks because of which they weigh out and bulk out at about the same point. The roll-over accidents could be reduced by considering the speeds taking into account truck roll-over, by educating the logging truck drivers about the effects of speed on truck stability, and by increasing the speed enforcement efforts."

The broad aim of this study was to evaluate the overall impact of the package on crash outcomes. Monthly crash counts and injury severity proportions were assessed using Poisson and logistic regression models respectively. The model measured the overall effect of the package after adjusting as far as possible for non-speed road safety initiatives and socio-economic factors. The speed-related package was associated with statistically significant estimated reductions in casualty crashes and suggested reductions in injury severity with trends towards increased reductions over time. From December 2000 until July 2002, three new speed enforcement initiatives were implemented in Victoria, Australia. These initiatives were introduced in stages and involved the following key components: More covert operations of mobile speed cameras, including flash-less operations; 50% increase in speed camera operating hours; and lowering of cameras' speed detection threshold. In addition, during the period 2001 to 2002, the 50 km/h General Urban Speed Limit (GUSL) was introduced (January 2001), there was an increase in speed-related advertising including the ""Wipe Off 5"" campaign, media announcements were made related to the above enforcement initiatives and there was a speeding penalty restructure. The above elements combine to make up a package of speed-related initiatives and factors. The package represents a broad, long term program by Victorian government agencies to reduce speed based on three linked strategies: more intensive Police enforcement of speed limits to deter potential offenders, i.e. the three new speed enforcement initiatives just described - supported by higher penalties; a reduction in the speed limit on local streets throughout Victoria from 60 km/h to 50 km/h; and provision of information using the mass media (television, radio and billboard) to reinforce the benefits of reducing low level speeding - the central message of ""Wipe Off 5"". These strategies were implemented across the entire state of Victoria with the intention of covering as many road users as possible."

Our proposed approach, Speed Vision by License Plate Reading LPR, (patent pending) is aimed to compute the instantaneous speed of the vehicles using monocular as well as binocular system configurations. By tracking the vehicle in the two images it is possible to get a high accurate estimation of the vehicle speed. The features used for matching and tracking are high level features (clusters of matched license plate characters). The processing system is actually connected into a larger distributed architecture based on standard CORBA interfaces to achieve a more efficient interconnection between the peripheral units (both License Plate readers and Speed enforcement systems) and the central supervisor. The description of the processing scheme is supported by a simulation model, that is used to identify the most critical parameters of the system. Experimental results in the lab environment are discussed, by computing the accuracy in the computation of license plate displacement in different configurations. Finally, a series of experimental results have been obtained using a binocular license plate reading system."

Although traditional speed enforcement has been shown to reduce speeds through the work area, enforcement under these conditions can be dangerous to both the motoring public and enforcement officers. The work zone layout often limits the locations at which an officer can set up to enforce the speed limit and the locations at which violators can be stopped. Automated speed enforcement technology could help eliminate the need to stop violators in a work zone, but it is not currently a popular concept in the United States because of concerns about motorist privacy. Researchers hypothesized that this technology could be useful for work zone enforcement if adapted to a more real-time operation. The initial testing of the concept of remote speed enforcement is summarized. An automated speed enforcement system (consisting of digital video and lidar technology) was meshed with a wireless communications system. The unit determined when vehicles exceeded a certain speed threshold. If a vehicle was detected as exceeding the threshold, a digital photograph was taken of the violator. This photograph was then transmitted to an observer stationed downstream of the site. The technical feasibility of the system was assessed through field tests. Focus groups of law enforcement personnel were used to determine potential acceptance of the system in the law enforcement community. Recommendations for future improvements and possible applications of the system are made."

It was found that there is the potential for a 2.5% error (for a radar aligned at 22° to the road, with a -3 dB beamwidth of 5°) in the speed measured by the radar devices. This is because of the interference between the RCS and the radar beam pattern, if only the main lobe is considered. There are cases, however, when the interference between the RCS and the radar beam patterns are such that the strongest return occurs in the first sidelobe. In these cases, the potential speed error is about 7%. This would be unlikely to occur in practice, however, because of the inverse fourth-power relationship with range.

In recent years, awareness of this problem has become especially acute in the United States. In San Francisco, California, with its compact driving environment and dense network of signalized intersections, red-light running reached a political crisis in 1994. The city and county of San Francisco recently completed a pilot red-light photo-enforcement program. The number of vehicles photographed violating red lights at the photo-enforced locations dropped by more than 40 percent just 6 months into the pilot. Recent statistics indicate that San Francisco's combined efforts to combat red-light running have resulted in a significant decrease in the number of annual collisions caused by red-light violators citywide. Based on the success of the pilot and supportive state legislation, San Francisco is moving forward to expand the red-light photo-enforcement program. This collaborative effort involving several agencies soon will be one of the largest programs in the United States, with 26 cameras rotated through 36 intersections. San Francisco's experience with red-light photo enforcement is valuable for all jurisdictions considering the use of automated enforcement. Discussion includes the level of preparation required to initiate a program, the legal framework, the cost-effectiveness of automated enforcement, the criteria for site selection, and suggestions for increasing citation issuance rates. Recommendations from San Francisco's experience stress the importance of creating partnerships within your agency and without, combining engineering and enforcement efforts with an educational campaign, and influencing local legislation."

Methods: Red light violation behavior was examined using about 47,000 violation records that were captured by photo enforcement cameras from 11 signalized intersections in the city of Sacramento, California, over a four-year period. This examination identified factors with strong correlation to red light running behavior. Results: Key findings based on Sacramento's red light violation records include: (a) younger drivers showed a higher tendency of running the red light and were more likely to commit such a violation at speeds above the posted speed limit; (b) off-peak time period between 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. had lower violation counts, but red light violators in this time frame had a higher propensity of racing through intersections at high speeds; (c) also during the time period between 8 p.m. to 5 a.m., violators showed a higher probability of entering intersections two or more seconds after the onset of red light; and (d) violators were less likely to cross high traffic-volume intersections with speeds greater than the posted speed limit. Discussion: Sacramento's data suggest that some red light violators might have committed such an offense unintentionally.

Approximately 60 percent of these collisions have occurred at intersections, accounting for 65 percent of the total injuries and 40 percent of the total fatalities reported. Through engineering, education, enforcement and evaluation, the City of Edmonton and Edmonton Police Service are working to reduce the number of collisions and injuries, which are resulting from driver behaviour and related human factors. Edmonton has been an active partner of the Capital Region Intersection Safety Partnership (CRISP) since its development in 2000. The mandate of CRISP is to build awareness for traffic safety issues at intersections. The group has successfully implemented public awareness campaigns addressing red light running, pedestrian safety and speeding through intersections. The Edmonton Red Light Camera Program was launched in 1999 and will ultimately operate with 20 cameras and 60 locations by the end of 2004. Existing locations have shown an average of less than 3 violations per day, which is down from the 9.6 violations per day that were observed in the early stages of our pilot project. This program is currently being reviewed with the intent of expanding enforcement strategies to include automated intersection speed enforcement. Since the early 1990's Edmonton has maintained a High Collision Location Program to address traffic safety at intersections. Each year, high collision intersections with a history of injuries, fatalities and property damage are assessed for engineering alternatives, enforcement strategies and signed to build awareness for the predominant collision types. Edmonton is currently enhancing this program through the development of Safety Performance Functions and an accompanying Network Screening Tool. The Network Screening Tool will allow the City to quantify the worst intersections based on several factors including collision number, collision rate, property damage and injuries The Edmonton Police Service has developed a program that targets high-risk drivers. This program correlates several behaviours and characteristics such as driving history, criminal record, age and other factors to develop a profile of a high-risk driver. Drivers who fall into this category are identified and enforcement is focused on them. This paper discusses the programs and initiatives the City of Edmonton and Edmonton Police Service are undertaking to reduce the frequency and severity of the traffic collisions that are influenced by driver behaviour and related human factors."

Exposure measurements were taken at approximated ocular and testicular levels of officers seated in patrol vehicles. Comparisons were made of the radar manufacturers' published maximum power density specifications and actual measured power densities taken at the antenna faces of those units. Four speed-enforcement agencies and one transportation research institute provided 54 radar units for evaluation; 17 different models, encompassing 4 frequency bands and 3 antenna configurations, were included. Four of the 986 measurements taken exceeded the 5 mW/cm2 limit accepted by the International Radiation Protection Association and the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurement, though none exceeded the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists, American National Standards Institute, Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, or Occupational Safety and Health Administration standard of 10 mW/cm2. The four high measurements were maximum power density readings taken directly in front of the radar. Of the 812 measurements taken at the officers' seated ocular and testicular positions, none exceeded 0.04 mW/cm2; the highest of these (0.034 mW/cm2) was less than 1% of the most conservative current safety standards. High exposures in the limited region directly in front of the radar aperture are easily avoided with proper training. Results of this study indicate that police officer exposure to microwave radiation is apparently minimal. However, because of uncertainty in the medical and scientific communities concerning nonionizing radiation, it is recommended that law enforcement agencies implement a policy of prudent avoidance, including purchasing units with the lowest published maximum power densities, purchasing dash/rear deck-mounted units with antennae mounted outside the patrol vehicle, and training police officers to use the 'stand- by' mode when not actually using radar."

The French experience is unusual in many ways: (1) the system is largely independent (requiring minimal interventions by technical staff), (2) radar devices operate on a full-time basis and (3) cover the whole traffic network. This program represents a radical change for all drivers. While the risk of being arrested for speed limit violations was most unlikely before the introduction of the automated speed enforcement system, its implementation substantially increased the risk of being sanctioned for speeding. The development of such a system raises questions about, on one hand, strategies and implementation challenges experienced by the authorities, and on the other hand, the expected deterrent effects. All these elements nurture uncertainty for the political decision maker. The French system brings some interesting lessons. For the authorities, this automated system represents a useful tool to increase detection and to speed up the sanction process. This particular system yields a new type of deterrence, called network-centric deterrence, which is defined through this article."

If the engineers' judgement of the correct speed limit differs from that of most motorists, it is likely that there will be a high number of speed-limit violations. In recent years, speed cameras have been used increasingly as a form of speed enforcement, often with the view of lowering crash occurrence. Using Holland Road in Singapore as a case study, this paper examines the effectiveness of the speed camera by comparing the change in observed traffic speeds, the speed-limit compliance and the number of crashes before and after the installation of the camera. Following the installation of the camera, an overall reduction in mean speeds was observed as far as 500 m away from the camera position. A higher level of speed-limit compliance was also observed in the vicinity of the camera as motorists adjusted their speeds when they were within about 200-300 m of the camera position. The speed camera has also resulted in fewer crashes along the entire study roadway."

Drivers using radar detectors to warn of police speed enforcement activities respond to the warning and slow down, as do drivers of nearby vehicles. Speeds were measured with and without radar drones in operation at 12 construction and maintenance work zones and high crash locations in Missouri. It was found that mean speeds were moderately lower when radar was operating, and this effect was slightly greater for tractor-trailers than for passenger vehicles, although not significantly so at most locations. However, moderate reductions in mean speed were associated with more meaningful reductions in the number of vehicles exceeding the speed limit by more than 10 mph (17 kph), especially among tractor-trailers."

In the first experiment, the effect of three variables on driving speed on motorways was studied. The first variable, intensity of enforcement, was manipulated by creating three different objective levels of apprehension for detected speeding drivers. The second variable was method of enforcement. On-view stopping and ticketing of offenders was compared to mailing of fines on the basis of the car's licence plate number. The third variable manipulated was the time delay in the mailing of fines. Time delay between detection of the offence and feedback to the driver was shortened in one condition. In a second experiment, police enforcement effort was optimized by relating intensity level of enforcement to the proportion of speeding vehicles. In the first experiment, police enforcement was applied for four weeks; in the second experiment, enforcement activities were continued for 12 consecutive weeks. In both cases the main dependent variable was driving speed. Before, during, and after the application of enforcement, speed was registered using induction loops. In addition, driver opinion about speeding and speed enforcement was studied using postal questionnaire surveys. The results show the largest and longest lasting reduction in driving speed in the highest intensity level-condition, giving support for a relation between objective chance of apprehension and speed choice. On-view stopping of offenders was shown to be a more effective method to reduce driving speed than mailing of fines. Some of these results are discussed in the light of game theory. The questionnaire surveys indicated that most drivers did not notice the recurrence in enforcement activities due to infrequent passing of the sections of motorways studied. The preventive effect of police enforcement appeared to be far more substantial than its repressive effect. Enforcement primarily deters the current nonoffender from speeding. © 1994."

In this report, four experiments are described. Each experiment consisted of measuring speeds of vehicles before, during and after enforcement took place, accompanied by a control section to which no speed enforcement was applied. The four experiments differ in the number of days of enforcement. During experiments 1 and 2 considerable attrition of data occurred. Therefore, conclusions are based mainly on data obtained during experiments 3 and 4. The data base contains some 116,000 speed observations. For some experiments, the license plate record of vehicles was coded. This allows the tracing of the same vehicle day after day. Analysis leads to several conclusions. When enforcement is in place, the average speed of the traffic stream is reduced at the site of enforcement, upstream and downstream of it. At the site of speed limit enforcement, the average speed of the traffic stream is around the posted speed limit. This reduction in average speed decays (exponentially) with distance downstream. There is a distinct time halo effect. That is, the average speed is depressed from its pre-enforcement level after enforcement has been removed. For a single application of enforcement, the effect seems to vanish after 3 days. When the speed limit at a site is enforced for 5 consecutive days, the average speed remains depressed at least for 6 days after the last day of enforcement. In two of the experiments, enforcement was related to a reduction in the ""width"" of the speed distribution. In one experiment no such reduction occurred. When individual vehicles are traced day after day, it appears that repeated exposure to enforcement does not induce larger reductions in the speed of travel. It is also found that habitually fast and habitually slow drivers reduced their speed somewhat more than those driving at the average traffic stream speed. © 1982."

There was intense debate about the increase, and numerous evaluations were conducted afterwards. These evaluations share a common problem: they only measure the local effects of the change. But the change must be judged by its system-wide effects. In particular, the new 65 mph limit allowed the state highway patrols to shift their resources from speed enforcement on the interstates to other safety activities and other highways-a shift many highway patrol chiefs had argued for. If the chiefs were correct, the new allocation of patrol resources should lead to a reduction in statewide fatality rates. Similarly, the chance to drive faster on the interstates should attract drivers away from other, more dangerous roads, again generating system-wide consequences. This study measures these changes and obtains surprising results. We find that the 65 mph limit reduced statewide fatality rates by 3.4% to 5.1%, holding constant the effects of long-term trend, driving exposure, seat belt laws, and economic factors. © 1993."

Local automatic speed warning at an urban intersection reduced the mean speed by 5 km/hr. Theoretically, a reduction in accidents of 25 to 65 percent can be achieved. At a rural intersection, the speed limit was reduced from 100 to 70 km/hr. An automatic sign warns speeding cars; this resulted in a lowering of the mean speed from around 80 to 63 km/hr. An automatic speed warning and enforcement system on two-lane rural road stretches where the speed limit is 80 km/hr resulted in a reduction of the mean speed from 78 to 73 km/hr; the percentage of speeders decreased from 40 to 10 percent. The total number of accidents was reduced by 35 percent. This effect was almost the same three years after concluding the experiment. The problem of vandalism could be diminished by mounting the camera on a high pole, mechanically preventing climbing of the pole, automatic detection of vandalism, and wireless communication to a nearby police station. Enforcement of speed on a provincial road network using radar and camera exclusively from a parked unmarked car was conducted in three provinces. A sign downstream of the enforcement site read 'Your speed has been checked. Police.' Periodic information campaigns were conducted to increase awareness of the risk of being caught. The result was a reduction of average speed by 4 to 5 km/hr, although the percentage of speeders is still high a reduction from 40 to 30 percent. This type of enforcement is accepted by 75 percent of the drivers. Greater priority for speed enforcement is needed in addition to automating enforcement and processing to increase efficiency."

The impact load is produced by collision of a striking hammer at the speed from 5 to 25 m/s. In this paper, the authors took the impact problem of a reinforced concrete beam, one of the most basic elements in the structure, and conducted the experiment. Thus, the stress wave propagation and the distribution of the displacement in the beam were measured."

Blood-flow measurements were obtained at baseline, after warmup, and after each sequence of 20 pitches until 100 pitches were thrown. Blood flow was additionally determined 1 hour after the last pitch. The velocity of each pitch was recorded with a speed gun. Anthropomorphic measurements of the upper extremity were obtained at baseline and immediately after Pitch 100 using a standard measuring tape. The highest average arterial volume flow in the pitching arm occurred after 40 pitches, reaching a peak of 549 ml/min (56% increase from baseline). Thereafter, the average arterial blood flow steadily declined, reaching an average of 402 ml/min after the 100th pitch (14% increase from baseline). In contrast, the arterial blood flow in the nonpitching arm increased only slightly from baseline, reaching a maximal volume flow of 448 ml/min immediately after the warm-up period (10% increase from baseline). The volume flow then persistently fell to a level 30% below baseline after the 100th pitch. Although this small pilot study does not demonstrate causation between a decline in pitching performance and arterial blood flow, it suggests arterial flow in the dominant extremity falls as the pitch count increases."

The high speed gun performance depends upon the use of (1) gas valve ports near the muzzle end of the central electrode, (2) an optimized gas diffusion delay time, and (3) a small injected gas load. The 10-cm-diam gun employs a low inductance power supply and a light gas load to yield a plasma containing ∼5×1016 D+ ions with a mean energy of 13 keV. The larger 25-cm-diam gun requires more energy and a larger gas load to yield a plasma containing a similar number of D+ ions but at a higher mean energy of ∼20 keV. As an example of gun performance, the 25-cm-diam gun produces a neutron yield of ≈108 when incident upon a D2O ice target located 3 m from the gun muzzle. © 1963 The American Institute of Physics."
